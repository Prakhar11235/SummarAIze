Born in 1931, the son of a littleeducated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he hadan unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminatingin the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna.\\nAs chief of the country’s defence research anddevelopment programme, Kalam demonstrated the greatpotential for dynamism and innovation that existed inseemingly moribund research establishments. This is thestory of Kalam’s rise from obscurity and his personal andprofessional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi,Akash, Trishul and Nag - missiles that have becomehousehold names in India and that have raised the nation tothe level of a missile power of international recokoning.At the same time as he has helped create India’sawesome weaponry, Kalam has maintained the asceticrigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day andpracticing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalamascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influenceof his teachers and mentors. He describes the struggles ofhis boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life in asmall town in South India and the inspirational role ofeducators. He describes the role of visionary Indianscientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the creationof a coordinated network of research institutions. This isalso the saga of independent India’s struggle fortechnological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy – astory as much about politics, domestic and international, asit is about science.Arun Tiwari worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam forover a decade in the Defence Research and DevelopmentLaboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad. He is currently Director,Cardiovascular Technology Institute, Hyderabad, where heis pursuing Dr Kalam’s vision of developing cost-effectivemedical devices using indigenous defence technology.Dr Kalam is now India’s President. He was elected toIndia’s office by a huge majority in 2002.To the memory of my parentsMy MotherSea waves, golden sand, pilgrims’ faith,Rameswaram Mosque Street, all merge into one,My Mother!You come to me like heaven’s caring arms.I remember the war days when life was challenge and toil—Miles to walk, hours before sunrise,Walking to take lessons from the saintly teacher near thetemple.

This might seem to disqualify me as hisbiographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. Oneday, while speaking to him, Iasked him if he had a message for young Indians. Hismessage fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage toask him about his recollections so that I could pen themdown before they were buried irretrievably under the sandsof time.We had a long series of sittings late into the night andearly under the fading stars of dawn—all somehow stolenfrom his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. Theprofundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He hadtremendous vitality and obviously received immensepleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was notalways easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating.There were complexities, subtleties, and intriguingmetaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually theunfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuousdiscourse.When I sat down to write this book, I felt that it requiredgreater skills than I possessed. But realising theimportance of this task and regarding it an honour to havebeen permitted to attempt it, I prayed earnestly for thecourage and calibre to complete it.This book is written for the ordinary people of India forwhom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whomDr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport withthe humblest and simplest people, an indication of his ownsimplicity and innate spirituality.For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage.Through Dr Kalam, I was blessed with the revelation thatthe real joy of living can be found in only one way—in one’scommunion with an eternal source of hidden knowledgewithin oneself—which each individual is bidden to seek andfind for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet DrKalam in person, but I hope you will enjoy his companythrough this book, and that he will become your spiritualfriend.I could include in this book only a few incidents amongthe many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this book'),\n",

I thank Dr BSoma Raju for his tangible, but always unspoken support,for this project. My sincere thanks go to my wife andunsparing critic, Dr Anjana Tiwari, for her tough comments,accompanied with her gentle support.It has been a pleasure to work with Universities Press, andthe cooperation of the editorial and production staff is muchappreciated.There are many fine people, such as the photographerMr. Prabhu, who have selflessly enriched me and this bookin ways beyond measure. I thank them all.And finally, my deepest gratitude to my sons, Aseemand Amol— for their unfailing emotional support during thewriting, and because I seek in them that attitude towardslife which Dr Kalam admired, and wanted this work toreflect.Arun TiwariThis book is being released at a time when India’stechnological endeavours, to assert its sovereignty andstrengthen its security, are questioned by many in the world.Historically, people have always fought among themselveson one issue or another. Prehistorically, battles were foughtover food and shelter. With the passage of time, wars werewaged over religious and ideological beliefs; and now thedominant struggle of sophisticated warfare is for economicand technological supremacy. Consequently, economicand technological supremacy is equated with politicalpower and world control.Afew nations who have grown very strongtechnologically, over the past few centuries, have wrestedcontrol, for their own purposes. These major powers havebecome the self-proclaimed leaders of the new worldorder. What does a country of one billion people, like India,do in such a situation? We have no other option but to betechnologically strong. But, can India be a leader in the fieldof technology? My answer is an emphatic ‘Yes’. And let mevalidate my answer by narrating some incidents from mylife.When I first began the reminiscences that have goneinto this book, I was uncertain about which of my memorieswere worth narrating or were of any relevance at all. Mychildhood is precious to me, but would it be of interest toanyone else? Was it worth the reader’s while, I wondered,to know about the tribulations and triumphs of a smalltownboy? Of the straitened circumstances of my schooldays, theodd jobs I did to pay my school fees, and how my decisionto become a vegetarian was partly due to my financial'),\n",

In the end, I wasconvinced that these were relevant, if not for anything elsebut because they tell something of the story of modernIndia, as individual destiny and the social matrix in which itis embedded cannot be seen in isolation. Having beenpersuaded of this, it did seem germane to include theaccounts of my frustrated attempt to become an Air Forcepilot and of how I became, instead of the Collector myfather dreamed I would be, a rocket engineer.Finally, I decided to describe the individuals who had aprofound influence on my life. This book is also by way of asubmission of thanks, therefore, to my parents andimmediate family, and to the teachers and preceptors I wasfortunate to have had, both as a student and in myprofessional life. It is also a tribute to the unflaggingenthusiasm and efforts of my young colleagues who helpedto realise our collective dreams. The famous words of IsaacNewton about standing on the shoulders of giants are validfor every scientist and I certainly owe a great debt ofknowledge and inspiration to the distinguished lineage ofIndian scientists, that included Vikram Sarabhai, SatishDhawan and Brahm Prakash. They played major roles inmy life and in the story of Indian science.I completed sixty years of age on 15 October 1991. I haddecided to devote my retirement to fulfilling what I saw asmy duties in thesphere of social service. Instead, two things happenedsimultaneously. First, I agreed to continue in governmentservice for another three years and, next, a youngcolleague, Arun Tiwari, requested me to share myreminiscences with him, so that he could record them. Hewas someone who had been working in my laboratorysince 1982, but I had never really known him well until theFebruary of 1987 when I visited him at the IntensiveCoronary Care Unit of the Nizam’s Institute of MedicalSciences in Hyderabad. He was a mere 32 years old, butwas fighting valiantly for his life. I asked him if there wasanything he wanted me to do for him. “Give me yourblessings, sir,” he said, “so that I may have a longer life andcan complete at least one of your projects.”The young man’s dedication moved me and I prayed forhis recovery all night. The Lord answered my prayers andTiwari was able to get back to work in a month. He did anexcellent job in helping to realise the Akash missileairframe from scratch within the short space of three years.He then took up the task of chronicling my story. Over thelast year, he patiently transcribed the bits and pieces of mystory and converted them into a fluent narrative. He alsowent through my personal library meticulously and selectedfrom among the pieces of poetry those that I had markedwhile reading, and included them in the text.This story is an account, I hope, not just of my personaltriumphs and tribulations but of the successes andsetbacks of the science establishment in modern India,struggling to establish itself in the technological forefront. Itis the story of national aspiration and of cooperativeendeavour. And, as I see it, the saga of India’s search forscientific self-sufficiency and technological competence isa parable for our times.Each individual creature on this beautiful planet iscreated by God to fulfil a particular role. Whatever I haveachieved in life is through His help, and an expression ofHis will. He showered His grace on me through someoutstanding teachers and colleagues, and when I pay my'),\n",

Myfather, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal educationnor much wealth;despite these disadvantages, he possessed greatinnate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had anideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall theexact number of people she fed every day, but I am quitecertain that far more outsiders ate with us than all themembers of our own family put together.My parents were widely regarded as an ideal couple.My mother’s lineage was the more distinguished, one ofher forebears having been bestowed the title of ‘Bahadur’by the British.I was one of many children—a short boy with ratherundistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents.We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in themiddle of the 19th century. It was a fairly large pucca house,made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street inRameswaram. My austere father used to avoid allinessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessitieswere provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. Infact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, bothmaterially and emotionally.I normally ate with my mother, sitting on the floor of thekitchen. She would place a banana leaf before me, onwhich she then ladled rice and aromatic sambhar, a varietyof sharp, home-made pickles and a dollop of fresh coconutchutney.The famous Shiva temple, which made Rameswaramso sacred to pilgrims, was about a ten-minute walk fromour house. Our locality was predominantly Muslim, but therewere quite a few Hindu families too, living amicably withtheir Muslim neighbours. There was a very old mosque inour locality where my father would take me for eveningprayers. I had not the faintest idea of the meaning of theArabic prayers chanted, but I was totally convinced that theyreached God. When my father came out of the mosqueafter the prayers, people of different religions would besitting outside, waiting for him. Many of them offered bowlsof water to my father who would dip his fingertips in themand say a prayer. This water was then carried home forinvalids. I also remember people visiting our home to offerthanks after being cured. My father always smiled andasked them to thank Allah, the benevolent and merciful.The high priest of Rameswaram temple, PakshiLakshmana Sastry, was a very close friend of my father’s.One of the most vivid memories of my early childhood is ofthe two men, each in his traditional attire, discussingspiritual matters. When I was old enough to ask questions, Iasked my father about the relevance of prayer. My fathertold me there was nothing mysterious about prayer. Rather,prayer made possible a communion of the spirit betweenpeople. “When you pray,” he said, “you transcend your bodyand become a part of the cosmos, which knows no divisionof wealth, age, caste, or creed.”My father could convey complex spiritual concepts invery simple, downto-earth Tamil. He once told me, “In hisown time, in his own place, in what he really is, and in thestage he has reached—good or bad—every human beingis a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine'),\n",

So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings andproblems? When troubles come, try to understand therelevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presentsopportunities for introspection.”“Why don’t you say this to the people who come to youfor help and advice?” I asked my father. He put his handson my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes. For quitesome time he said nothing, as if he was judging mycapacity to comprehend his words. Then he answered in alow, deep voice. His answer filled me with a strange energyand enthusiasm:Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as anatural reaction, they start looking for company. Wheneverthey are in trouble, they look for someone to help them.Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone toshow them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing,and desire finds its own special helper. For the people whocome to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effortto propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.This is not a correct approach at all and should never befollowed. One must understand the difference between afear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables usto seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves.I remember my father starting his day at 4 a.m. byreading the namaz before dawn. After the namaz, he usedto walk down to a small coconut grove we owned, about 4miles from our home. He would return, with about a dozencoconuts tied together thrown over his shoulder, and onlythen would he have his breakfast. This remained his routineeven when he was in his late sixties.I have throughout my life tried to emulate my father in myown world of science and technology. I have endeavouredto understand the fundamental truths revealed to me by myfather, and feel convinced that there exists a divine powerthat can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy andfailure, and guide one to one’s true place. And once anindividual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he ison the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.I was about six years old when my father embarked onthe project of building a wooden sailboat to take pilgrimsfrom Rameswaram to Dhanuskodi, (also calledSethukkarai), and back. He worked at building the boat onthe seashore, with the help of a relative, Ahmed Jallaluddin,who later married my sister, Zohara. I watched the boattake shape. The wooden hull and bulkheads wereseasoned with the heat from wood fires. My father wasdoing good business with the boat when, one day, acyclone bringing winds of over 100 miles per hour carriedaway our boat, along with some of the landmass ofSethukkarai. The Pamban Bridge collapsed with a train fullof passengers on it. Until then, I had only seen the beauty ofthe sea, now its uncontrollable energy came as a revelationto me.By the time the boat met its untimely end, AhmedJallaluddin had become a close friend of mine, despite thedifference in our ages. He was about 15 years older than Iand used to call me Azad. We used to go for long walkstogether every evening. As we started from Mosque Streetand made our way towards the sandy shores of the island,Jallaluddin and I talked mainly of spiritual matters. Theatmosphere of Rameswaram, with its flocking pilgrims, wasconducive to such discussion. Our first halt would be at theimposing temple of Lord Shiva. Circling around the templewith the same reverence as any pilgrim from a distant partof the country, we felt a flow of energy pass through us.Jallaluddin would talk about God as if he had a working'),\n",

He would present all his doubts toGod as if He were standing nearby to dispose of them. Iwould stare at Jallaluddin and then look towards the largegroups of pilgrims around the temple, taking holy dips in thesea, performing rituals and reciting prayers with a sense ofrespect towards the same Unknown, whom we treat as theformless Almighty. I never doubted that the prayers in thetemple reached the same destination as the ones offeredin our mosque. I only wondered whether Jallaluddin had anyother special connection to God. Jallaluddin’s schoolinghad been limited, principally because of his family’sstraitened circumstances. This may have been the reasonwhy he always encouraged me to excel in my studies andenjoyed my success vicariously. Never did I find theslightest trace of resentment in Jallaluddin for hisdeprivation. Rather, he was always full of gratitude forwhatever life had chosen to give him.Incidentally, at the time I speak of, he was the onlyperson on the entire island who could write English. Hewrote letters for almost anybody in need, be they letters ofapplication or otherwise. Nobody of my acquaintance,either in my family or in the neighbourhood even hadJallaluddin’s level of education or any links of consequencewith the outside world. Jallaluddin always spoke to meabout educated people, of scientific discoveries, ofcontemporary literature, and of the achievements ofmedical science. It was he who made me aware of a“brave, new world” beyond our narrow confines.In the humble environs of my boyhood, books were ascarce commodity. By local standards, however, thepersonal library of STR Manickam, a former ‘revolutionary’or militant nationalist, was sizeable. He encouraged me toread all I could and I often visited his home to borrowbooks.Another person who greatly influenced my boyhood wasmy first cousin, Samsuddin. He was the sole distributor fornewspapers in Rameswaram. The newspapers wouldarrive at Rameswaram station by the morning train fromPamban. Samsuddin’s newspaper agency was a one-manorganization catering to the reading demands of the 1,000-strong literate population of Rameswaram town. Thesenewspapers were mainly bought to keep abreast of currentdevelopments in the National Independence Movement, forastrological reference or to check the bullion ratesprevailing in Madras. A few readers with a morecosmopolitan outlook would discuss Hitler, MahatmaGandhi and Jinnah; almost all would finally flow into themighty political current of Periyar EV Ramaswamy’smovement against high caste Hindus. Dinamani was themost sought after newspaper. Since reading the printedmatter was beyond my capability, I had to satisfy myselfwith glancing at the pictures in the newspaper beforeSamsuddin delivered them to his customers.The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I waseight years old. For reasons I have never been able tounderstand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds eruptedin the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to aprovision shop on Mosque Street. A day’s collection wouldfetch me the princely sum of one anna. Jallaluddin would tellme stories about the war which I would later attempt totrace in the headlines in Dinamani. Our area, beingisolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soonIndia was forced to join the Allied Forces and somethinglike a state of emergency was declared. The first casualtycame in the form of the suspension of the train halt at'),\n",

The newspapers now had to bebundled and thrown out from the moving train on theRameswaram Road between Rameswaram andDhanuskodi.

Half a centurylater, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my ownmoney for the first time.Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics,into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment,and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. Iinherited honesty and self-discipline from my father; frommy mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindnessand so did my three brothers and sister. But it was the timeI spent with Jallaluddin and Samsuddin that perhapscontributed most to the uniqueness of my childhood andmade all the difference in my later life. The unschooledwisdom of Jallaluddin and Samsuddin was so intuitive andresponsive to non-verbal messages, that I canunhesitatingly attribute my subsequently manifestedcreativity to their company in my childhood.I had three close friends in my childhood—RamanadhaSastry, Aravindan, and Sivaprakasan. All these boys werefrom orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none ofus ever felt any difference amongst ourselves because ofour religious differences and upbringing. In fact,Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi LakshmanaSastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Later,he took over the priesthood of the Rameswaram templefrom his father; Aravindan went into the business ofarranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasanbecame a catering contractor for the Southern Railways.During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony,our family used to arrange boats with a special platform forcarrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriagesite, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirthawhich was near our house. Events from the Ramayana andfrom the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories mymother and grandmother would tell the children in ourfamily.One day when I was in the fifth standard at theRameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher came toour class. I used to wear a cap which marked me as aMuslim, and I always sat in the front row next to RamanadhaSastry, who wore a sacred thread. The new teacher couldnot stomach a Hindu priest’s son sitting with a Muslim boy.In accordance with our social ranking as the new teachersaw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench. I feltvery sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry. He looked utterlydowncast as I shifted to my seat in the last row. The imageof him weeping when I shifted to the last row left a lastingimpression on me.After school, we went home and told our respectiveparents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summonedthe teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that heshould not spread the poison of social inequality andcommunal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. Hebluntly asked the teacher to either apologize or quit theschool and the island. Not only did the teacher regret hisbehaviour, but the strong sense of conviction LakshmanaSastry conveyed ultimately reformed this young teacher.On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram washighly stratified and very rigid in terms of the segregation ofdifferent social groups. However, my science teacherSivasubramania Iyer, though an orthodox Brahmin with avery conservative wife, was something of a rebel. He did'),\n",

He used to spend hourswith me and would say, “Kalam, I want you to develop sothat you are on par with the highly educated people of thebig cities.”One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wifewas horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being invited todine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused to serve me inher kitchen. Sivasubramania Iyer was not perturbed, nor didhe get angry with his wife, but instead, served me with hisown hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. Hiswife watched us from behind the kitchen door. I wonderedwhether she had observed any difference in the way I aterice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When Iwas leaving his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me tojoin him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing myhesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying, “Once youdecide to change the system, such problems have to beconfronted.” When I visited his house the next week,Sivasubramania Iyer’s wife took me inside her kitchen andserved me food with her own hands.Then the Second World War was over and India’sfreedom was imminent. “Indians will build their own India,”declared Gandhiji. The whole country was filled with anunprecedented optimism. I asked my father’s permission toleave Rameswaram and study at the district headquartersin Ramanathapuram.He told me as if thinking aloud, “Abul! I know you haveto go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly across the Sun,alone and without a nest? You must forego your longing forthe land of your memories to move into the dwelling placeof your greater desires; our love will not bind you nor will ourneeds hold you.” He quoted Khalil Gibran to my hesitantmother, “Your children are not your children. They are thesons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They comethrough you but not from you. You may give them your lovebut not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.”He took me and my three brothers to the mosque andrecited the prayer Al Fatiha from the Holy Qur’an. As he putme on the train at Rameswaram station he said, “Thisisland may be housing your body but not your soul. Yoursoul dwells in the house of tomorrow which none of us atRameswaram can visit, not even in our dreams. May Godbless you, my child!”Samsuddin and Ahmed Jallaluddin travelled with me toRamanathapuram to enrol me in Schwartz High School,and to arrange for my boarding there. Somehow, I did nottake to the new setting. The town of Ramanathapuram wasa thriving, factious town of some fifty thousand people, butthe coherence and harmony of Rameswaram was absent. Imissed my home and grabbed every opportunity to visitRameswaram. The pull of educational opportunities atRamanathapuram was not strong enough to nullify theattraction of poli, a South Indian sweet my mother made. Infact, she used to prepare twelve distinctly different varietiesof it, bringing out the flavour of every single ingredient usedin the best possible combinations.Despite my homesickness, I was determined to cometo terms with the new environment because I knew myfather had invested great hopes in my success. My fathervisualized me as a Collector in the making and I thought itmy duty to realise my father’s dream, although I desperatelymissed the familiarity, security and comforts ofRameswaram.Jallaluddin used to speak to me about the power of'),\n",

My teacher, Iyadurai Solomon, was anidealguide for an eager young mind that was yet uncertain ofthe possibilities and alternatives that lay before it. He madehis students feel very comfortable in class with his warmand open-minded attitude. He used to say that a goodstudent could learn more from a bad teacher than a poorstudent from even a skilled teacher.During my stay at Ramanathapuram, my relationshipwith him grew beyond that of teacher and pupil. In hiscompany, I learnt that one could exercise enormousinfluence over the events of one’s own life. IyaduraiSolomon used to say, “To succeed in life and achieveresults, you must understand and master three mightyforces— desire, belief, and expectation.” Iyadurai Solomon,who later became a Reverend, taught me that beforeanything I wanted could happen, I had to desire it intenselyand be absolutely certain it would happen. To take anexample from my own life, I had been fascinated by themysteries of the sky and the flight of birds from earlychildhood. I used to watch cranes and seagulls soar intoflight and longed to fly. Simple, provincial boy though I was, Iwas convinced that one day I, too, would soar up into theskies. Indeed, I was the first child from Rameswaram to fly.Iyadurai Solomon was a great teacher because heinstilled in all the children a sense of their own worth.Solomon raised my self-esteem to a high point andconvinced me, the son of parents who had not had thebenefits of education, that I too could aspire to becomewhatever I wished. “With faith, you can change yourdestiny,” he would say.One day, when I was in the fourth form, my mathematicsteacher, Ramakrishna Iyer, was teaching another class.Inadvertently, I wandered into that classroom and in themanner of an old-fashioned despot, Ramakrishna Iyercaught me by the neck and caned me in front of the wholeclass. Many months later, when I scored full marks inmathematics, he narrated the incident to the entire schoolat morning assembly. “Whomsoever I cane becomes agreat man! Take my word, this boy is going to bring glory tohis school and to his teachers.” His praise quite made upfor the earlier humiliation!By the time I completed my education at Schwartz, I wasa selfconfident boy determined to succeed. The decision togo in for further education was taken without a secondthought. To us, in those days, the awareness of thepossibilities for a professional education did not exist;higher education simply meant going to college. Thenearest college was at Tiruchchirappalli, spelledTrichinopoly those days, and called Trichi for short.In 1950, I arrived at St. Joseph’s College, Trichi, tostudy for the Intermediate examination. I was not a brightstudent in terms of examination grades but, thanks to mytwo buddies back in Rameswaram, I had acquired apractical bent of mind.Whenever I returned to Rameswaram from Schwartz,my elder brother Mustafa Kamal, who ran a provision storeon the railway station road, would call me in to give him alittle help and then vanish for hours together leaving the'),\n",

When spared by Mustafa, Iwould be put in charge of his kiosk by my younger brother,Kasim Mohammed. There I sold novelties made ofseashells.At St. Joseph’s, I was lucky to find a teacher like theRev. Father TN Sequeira. He taught us English and wasalso our hostel warden. We were about a hundred boysliving in the three-storeyed hostel building. Rev. Fatherused to visit each boy every night with a Bible in his hand.His energy and patience was amazing. He was a veryconsiderate person who took care of even the most minuterequirements of his students. On Deepavali, on hisinstructions, the Brother in charge of the hostel and themess volunteers would visit each room and distribute goodgingelly oil for the ritual bath.I stayed on the St. Joseph’s campus for four years andshared my room with two others. One was an orthodoxIyengar from Srirangam and the other a Syrian Christianfrom Kerala. The three of us had a wonderful time together.When I was made secretary of the vegetarian mess duringmy third year in the hostel, we invited the Rector, Rev.Father Kalathil, over for lunch one Sunday. Our menuincluded the choicest preparations from our diversebackgrounds. The result was rather unexpected, but Rev.Father was lavish in his praise of our efforts. We enjoyedevery moment with Rev. Father Kalathil, who participated inour unsophisticated conversation with childlike enthusiasm.It was a memorable event for us all.My teachers at St. Joseph were the true followers ofKanchi Paramacharya, who evoked people to “enjoy theaction of giving”. The vivid memory of our mathematicsteachers, Prof. Thothathri Iyengar and Prof. SuryanarayanaSastry, walking together on the campus inspires me to thisday.When I was in the final year at St. Joseph’s, I acquired ataste for English literature. I began to read the greatclassics, Tolstoy, Scott and Hardy being special favouritesdespite their exotic settings, and then I moved on to someworks in Philosophy. It was around this time that Ideveloped a great interest in Physics.The lessons on subatomic physics at St. Joseph’s bymy physics teachers, Prof. Chinna Durai and Prof.Krishnamurthy, introduced me to the concept of the half-lifeperiod and matters related to the radioactive decay ofsubstances. Sivasubramania Iyer, my science teacher atRameswaram, had never taught me that most subatomicparticles are unstable and that they disintegrate after acertain time into other particles. All this I was learning forthe first time. But when he taught me to strive with diligencebecause decay is inherent in all compounded things, washe not talking of the same thing? I wonder why somepeople tend to see science as something which takes manaway from God. As I look at it, the path of science canalways wind through the heart. For me, science has alwaysbeen the path to spiritual enrichment and self-realisation.Even the rational thought-matrices of science havebeen home to fairy tales. I am an avid reader of books oncosmology and enjoy reading about celestial bodies. Manyfriends, while asking me questions related to space flights,sometimes slip into astrology. Quite honestly, I have neverreally understood the reason behind the great importanceattached by people to the faraway planets in our solarsystem.

Ido not know how these myths evolved about planets, starconstellations, and even satellites—that they can exercisepower on human beings. The highly complicatedcalculations manipulated around the precise movements ofcelestial bodies, to derive highly subjective conclusionsappear illogical to me. As I see it, the Earth is the mostpowerful and energetic planet. As John Milton puts it sobeautifully in Paradise Lost, Book VIII:. . . What if the SunBe centre to the World, and other stars . . . . .The planet earth, so steadfast though she seem,In sensibly three different motions move?Wherever you go on this planet, there is movement andlife. Even apparently inanimate things like rocks, metal,timber, clay are full of intrinsic movement—with electronsdancing around each nucleus. This motion originates intheir response to the confinement imposed on them by thenucleus, by means of electric forces which try to hold themas close as possible. Electrons, just like any individual witha certain amount of energy, detest confinement. The tighterthe electrons are held by the nucleus, the higher their orbitalvelocity will be: in fact, the confinement of electrons in anatom results in enormous velocities of about 1000 km persecond! These high velocities make the atom appear arigid sphere, just as a fast-moving fan appears like a disc. Itis very difficult to compress atoms more strongly—thusgiving matter its familiar solid aspect. Everything solid,thus, contains much empty space within and everythingstationary contains great movement within. It is as thoughthe great dance of Shiva is being performed on earthduring every moment of our existence.When I joined the B.Sc. degree course at St.Joseph’s, Iwas unaware of any other option for higher education. Nordid I have any information about career opportunitiesavailable to a student of science. Only after obtaining aB.Sc. did I realise that physics was not my subject. I had togo into engineering to realise my dreams. I could havejoined the Engineering course long ago, right after finishingmy Intermediate course. Better late than never, I told myselfas I made the detour, applying for admission into theMadras Institute of Technology (MIT), regarded as thecrown jewel of technical education in South India at thattime.I managed to be on the list of selected candidates, butadmission to this prestigious institution was an expensiveaffair. Around a thousand rupees was required, and myfather could not spare that much money. At that time, mysister, Zohara, stood behind me, mortgaging her goldbangles and chain. I was deeply touched by herdetermination to see me educated and by her faith in myabilities. I vowed to release her bangles from mortgagewith my own earnings. The only way before me to earnmoney at that point of time was to study hard and get ascholarship. I went ahead at full steam.What fascinated me most at MIT was the sight of twodecommissioned aircraft displayed there for thedemonstration of the various subsystems of flyingmachines. I felt a strange attraction towards them, andwould sit near them long after other students had goneback to the hostel, admiring man’s will to fly free in the sky,like a bird. After completing my first year, when I had to optfor a specific branch, I almost spontaneously choseaeronautical engineering. The goal was very clear in mymind now; I was going to fly aircraft. I was convinced of this,'),\n",

Dr Tank later joined the Hindustan AeronauticsLimited (HAL) in Bangalore and was responsible for thedesign of India’s first jet fighter, the HF-24 Marut.Notwithstanding these irritants, Prof. Sponderpreserved his individuality and maintained highprofessional standards.

Iconsulted him before opting for aeronautical engineering.He told me that one should never worry about one’s futureprospects: instead, it was more important to lay soundfoundations, to have sufficient enthusiasm and anaccompanying passion for one’s chosen field of study. Thetrouble with Indians, Prof. Sponder used to observe, wasnot that they lacked educational opportunities or industrialinfrastructure—the trouble was in their failure todiscriminate between disciplines and to rationalise theirchoices. Why aeronautics? Why not electrical engineering?Why not mechanical engineering? I myself would like to tellall novitiate engineering students that when they choosetheir specialization, the essential point to consider iswhether the choice articulates their inner feelings andaspirations.Prof. KAV Pandalai taught me aero-structure designand analysis. He was a cheerful, friendly and enthusiasticteacher, who brought a fresh approach to every year’steaching course. It was Professor Pandalai who opened upthe secrets of structural engineering to us. Even today Ibelieve that everyone who has been taught by Prof.Pandalai would agree that he was a man of greatintellectual integrity and scholarship—but with no trace ofarrogance. His students were free to disagree with him onseveral points in the classroom.Prof. Narasingha Rao was a mathematician, who taughtus theoretical aerodynamics. I still remember his method ofteaching fluid dynamics. After attending his classes, Ibegan to prefer mathematical physics to any other subject.Often, I have been told I carry a “surgical knife” toaeronautical design reviews. If it had not been for Prof.Rao’s kind and persistent advice on picking up proofs toequations of aerodynamic flow, I would not have acquiredthis metaphorical tool.Aeronautics is a fascinating subject, containing within itthe promise of freedom. The great difference betweenfreedom and escape, between motion and movement,between slide and flow are the secrets of this science. Myteachers revealed these truths to me. Through theirmeticulous teaching, they created within me an excitementabout aeronautics. Their intellectual fervour, clarity ofthought and passion for perfection helped me to launch intoa serious study of fluid dynamicsmodes of compressiblemedium motion, development of shock waves and shock,induced flow separation at increasing speeds, shock stalland shock-wave drag.Slowly, a great amalgamation of information took placein my mind. The structural features of aeroplanes began togain new meanings— biplanes, monoplanes, taillessplanes, canard configured planes, deltawing planes, allthese began to assume increasing significance for me. Thethree teachers, all of them authorities in their different fields,helped me to mould a composite knowledge.My third and last year at MIT was a year of transitionand was to have a great impact on my later life. In thosedays, a new climate of political enlightenment and industrialeffort was sweeping across the country. I had to test mybelief in God and see if it could fit into the matrix ofscientific thinking. The accepted view was that a belief inscientific methods was the only valid approach toknowledge. If so, I wondered, was matter alone the ultimatereality and were spiritual phenomena but a manifestation ofmatter? Were all ethical values relative, and was sensoryperception the only source of knowledge and truth? Iwondered about these issues, attempting to sort out the'),\n",

The value system in which I had been nurturedwas profoundly religious. I had been taught that true realitylay beyond the material world in the spiritual realm, and thatknowledge could be obtained only through innerexperience.Meanwhile, when I had finished my course work, I wasassigned a project to design a low-level attack aircrafttogether with four other colleagues. I had taken up theresponsibility of preparing and drawing the aerodynamicdesign. My team mates distributed among themselves thetasks of designing the propulsion, structure, control andinstrumentation of the aircraft. One day, my design teacher,Prof. Srinivasan, then the Director of the MIT, reviewed myprogress and declared it dismal and disappointing. Ioffered a dozen excuses for the delay, but none of themimpressed Prof. Srinivasan. I finally pleaded for a month’stime to complete the task. The Professor looked at me forsome time and said, “Look, young man, today is Fridayafternoon. I give you three days’ time. If by Monday morningI don’t get the configuration drawing, your scholarship willbe stopped.” I was dumbstruck. The scholarship was mylifeline and I would be quite helpless if it was withdrawn. Icould see no other way out but to finish the task as I hadbeen instructed. That night, I remained at the drawingboard, skipping dinner. Next morning, I took only an hour’sbreak to freshen up and eat a little food. On Sundaymorning, I was very near completion, when suddenly I feltsomeone else’s presence in the room. Prof. Srinivasanwas watching me from a distance. Coming straight from thegymkhana, he was still in his tennis outfit and had droppedin to see my progress. After examining my work, Prof.Srinivasan hugged me affectionately and patted my back inappreciation. He said, “I knew I was putting you understress and asking you to meet an impossible deadline. Inever expected you to perform so well.”During the rest of the period of the project, I participatedin an essay competition organized by the MIT TamilSangam (Literary Society). Tamil is my mother tongue and Iam proud of its origins, which have been traced back toSage Agastya in the pre-Ramayana period; its literaturedates back to the fifth century BC. It is said to be alanguage moulded by lawyers and grammarians and isinternationally acclaimed for its clear-cut logic. I was veryenthusiastic about ensuring that science did not remainoutside the purview of this wonderful language. I wrote anarticle entitled “Let Us Make Our Own Aircraft” in Tamil. Thearticle evoked much interest and I won the competition,taking the first prize from ‘Devan’, the editor of the popularTamil weekly, Ananda Vikatan.My most touching memory of MIT is related to Prof.Sponder. We were posing for a group photograph as partof a farewell ritual. All the graduating students had lined upin three rows with the professors seated in the front.Suddenly, Prof. Sponder got up and looked for me. I wasstanding in the third row. “Come and sit with me in thefront,” he said. I was taken aback by Prof. Sponder’sinvitation. “You are my best student and hard work will helpyou bring a great name for your teachers in future.”Embarrassed by the praise but honoured by therecognition, I sat with Prof. Sponder for the photograph.“Let God be your hope, your stay, your guide and providethe lantern for your feet in your journey into the future,” saidthe introverted genius, bidding me adieu.From MIT, I went to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited'),\n",

I didcalibrations of a fixedpitch fan fitted to a super-chargedengine. I opened up pressure and acceleration-cum-speedcontrol systems, and air starter supply systems of turbo-engines. Getting to understand feathering, un-featheringand reversing of propeller engines was very interesting.The demonstration of the delicate art of beta (blade anglecontrol) by HAL technicians still lingers in my memory. Theyhad neither studied in major universities, nor were theymerely implementing what their engineer-in-charge wassuggesting. They had been working hands-on for years andthis had given them something like an intuitive feel for thework.Two alternative opportunities for employment, bothclose to my longstanding dream of flying, presentedthemselves before me when I came out of HAL as agraduate aeronautical engineer. One was a career in theAir Force and another was a job at the Directorate ofTechnical Development and Production, DTD&P(Air), atthe Ministry of Defence. I applied for both. The interviewcalls arrived from both the places almost simultaneously. Iwas asked to reach Dehra Dun by the Air Forcerecruitment authorities and Delhi by DTD&P(Air). The boyfrom the Coromandel Coast took a train to the North ofIndia. My destination was more than 2000 km away, andwas to be my first encounter with the vastness of mymotherland.* * *'),\n",

Isat glued to the window. Almost everywhere, people wereengaged in some activity which had a rhythm andtranquillity about it—men driving cattle, women fetchingwater from streams. Occasionally, a child would appearand wave at the train.It is astonishing how the landscape changes as onemoves northwards. The rich and fertile plains of the riverGanga and its numerous tributaries have invited invasion,turmoil, and change. Around 1500 BC, fair-skinned Aryansswept in through the mountain passes from the far north-west. The tenth century brought Muslims, who later mingledwith the local people and became an integral part of thiscountry. One empire gave way to another. Religiousconquests continued. All this time, the part of India south ofthe Tropic of Cancer remained largely untouched, safebehind the shield of the Vindhya and Satpura mountainranges. The Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, Godavari, andKrishna rivers had woven a net of almost unassailableprotection for the tapering Indian peninsula. To bring me toDelhi, my train had crossed all these geographicalimpediments through the power of scientific advancement.I halted for a week in Delhi, the city of the great SufiSaint Hazrat Nizamuddin, and appeared for the interview atDTD&P(Air). I did well at the interview. The questions wereof a routine nature, and did not challenge my knowledge ofthe subject. Then I proceeded to Dehra Dun for myinterview at the Air Force Selection Board. At the SelectionBoard, the emphasis was more on “personality” than onintelligence. Perhaps they were looking for physical fitnessand an articulate manner. I was excited but nervous,determined but anxious, confident but tense. I could onlyfinish ninth in the batch of 25 examined to select eightofficers for commissioning in the Air Force. I was deeplydisappointed. It took me some time to comprehend that theopportunity to join the Air Force had just slipped through myfingers. I dragged myself out of the Selection Board andstood at the edge of a cliff. There was a lake far below. Iknew that the days ahead would be difficult. There werequestions to be answered and a plan of action to beprepared. I trekked down to Rishikesh.I bathed in the Ganga and revelled in the purity of itswater. Then, I walked to the Sivananda Ashram situated alittle way up the hill. I could feel intense vibrations when Ientered. I saw a large number of sadhus seated all aroundin a state of trance. I had read that sadhus were psychicpeople—people who know things intuitively and, in mydejected mood, I sought answers to the doubts thattroubled me.I met Swami Sivananda—a man who looked like aBuddha, wearing a snow-white dhoti and wooden slippers.He had an olive complexion and black, piercing eyes. I wasstruck by his irresistible, almost childlike smile andgracious manner. I introduced myself to the Swamiji. MyMuslim name aroused no reaction in him.

He offered no explanation of how he knew that Iwas sad and I did not ask.I told him about my unsuccessful attempt to join theIndian Air Force and my long-cherished desire to fly. Hesmiled, washing away all my anxiety almost instantly. Thenhe said in a feeble, but very deep voice,Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when itis pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagneticenergy. This energy is released into the ether each night,as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning itreturns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmiccurrents. That which has been imaged will surely andcertainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon thisageless promise as surely as you can rely upon theeternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.When the student is ready, the teacher will appear—How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to astudent who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destinyand go ahead with your life. You are not destined tobecome an Air Force pilot. What you are destined tobecome is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forgetthis failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destinedpath. Search, instead, for the true purpose of yourexistence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrenderyourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.I returned to Delhi and enquired at the DTD&P(Air)about the outcome of my interview. In response, I washanded my appointment letter. I joined the next day asSenior Scientific Assistant on a basic salary of Rs 250/-per month. If this was to be my destiny, I thought, let it be so.Finally, I was filled with mental peace. No more did I feelany bitterness or resentment at my failure to enter the AirForce. All this was in 1958.At the Directorate, I was posted at the Technical Centre(Civil Aviation). If I was not flying aeroplanes, I was at leasthelping to make them airworthy. During my first year in theDirectorate, I carried out a design assignment onsupersonic target aircraft with the help of the officer-in-charge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from theDirector, Dr Neelakantan. To gain shop-floor exposure toaircraft maintenance, I was sent to the Aircraft andArmament Testing Unit (A&ATU) at Kanpur. At that time,they were involved in a tropical evaluation of Gnat Mk Iaircraft. I participated in the performance assessment of itsoperation systems.Even in those days, Kanpur was a very populous city. Itwas my first experience of living in an industrial town. Thecold weather, crowds, noise and smoke were in totalcontrast to what I was used to in Rameswaram. I wasparticularly troubled by the ubiquitous presence of potatoeson the dining table, right from breakfast to dinner. To me, itseemed that a feeling of loneliness pervaded the city. Thepeople on the streets had all come from their villages insearch of jobs in factories, leaving behind the smell of theirsoil and the protection of their families.On my return to Delhi, I was informed that the design ofa DART target had been taken up at the DTD&P (Air) andthat I had been included in the design team. I completedthis task with the other team members. Then, I undertook apreliminary design study on a Human Centrifuge. I latercarried out the design and development of a VerticalTakeoff and Landing Platform. I was also associated withthe development and construction of the Hot Cockpit. Threeyears passed. Then the Aeronautical DevelopmentEstablishment (ADE) was born in Bangalore and I wasposted to the new establishment.'),\n",

Infact, I feel our country has an uncanny way of bringing outextremes in her people. I suppose, it is because Indianshave been both afflicted and enriched by centuries ofmigrations. Loyalty to different rulers has dulled ourcapacity for a single allegiance. Instead, we havedeveloped an extraordinary ability to be compassionateand cruel, sensitive and callous, deep and fickle, all at thesame time. To the untrained eye, we may appear colourfuland picturesque; to the critical eye, we are but shoddyimitations of our various masters. In Kanpur, I saw paan-chewing imitations of Wajid Ali Shah, and in Bangalore itwas replaced by dog-walking sahibs. Here too, I longed forthe depth and calmness of Rameswaram. The relationshipbetween the heart and the head of an earthy Indian hasbeen eroded by the divided sensibilities of our cities. Ispent my evenings exploring the gardens and shoppingplazas of Bangalore.The workload at ADE during the first year of itsinception was quite light. In fact, I had to generate work formyself at first, until the tempo gradually built up. Based onmy preliminary studies on ground-handling equipment, aproject team was formed to design and develop anindigenous hovercraft prototype as a ground equipmentmachine (GEM). The team was a small working group,comprising four persons at the level of Scientific Assistant.Dr OP Mediratta, Director of the ADE, asked me to leadthe team. We were given three years to launch theengineering model.The project was, by any standards, bigger than ourcollective capabilities. None of us had any experience inbuilding a machine, let alone a flying machine. There wereno designs or standard components available to beginwith. All we knew was that we had to make a successfulheavier-than-air flying machine. We tried to read as muchliterature as we could find on hovercrafts, but there was notmuch available. We tried to consult people knowledgeablein this area, but could find none. One day, I simply took thedecision to proceed with the limited information andresources available.This endeavour to produce a wingless, light, swiftmachine opened the windows of my mind. I was quick tosee at least a metaphorical connection between ahovercraft and an aircraft. After all, the Wright Brothersmade the first aeroplane after fixing bicycles for sevenyears! I saw in the GEM project great opportunities foringenuity and growth. We went straight into hardwaredevelopment after spending a few months on the drawingboard.There is always the danger that a person with my kind ofbackground— rural or small-town, middle-class, whoseparents had limited education— will retreat into a cornerand remain there struggling for bare existence, unlesssome great turn of circumstance propels him into a morefavourable environment. I knew I had to create my ownopportunities.Part by part, subsystem by subsystem, stage by stage,things started moving. Working on this project, I learnedthat once your mind stretches to a new level it never goesback to its original dimension.At that time VK Krishna Menon was the DefenceMinister. He was keenly interested in the progress of oursmall project, which he envisioned as the beginning of theindigenous development of India’s defence equipment.Whenever he was in Bangalore, he always found some'),\n",

His confidence inour ability ignited our enthusiasm. I would enter theassembly shop leaving my other problems outside, just asmy father used to enter the mosque for prayer, leaving hisshoes outside.But not everyone accepted Krishna Menon’s opinionabout GEM. Our experiments with the available parts andcomponents did not exactly delight my senior colleagues.Many even called us a group of eccentric inventors inpursuit of an impossible dream. I, being the leader of the“navvies”, was a particularly inviting target. I was regardedas yet another country bumpkin who believed that riding theair was his domain. The weight of opinion against usbuttressed my ever-optimistic mind. The comments ofsome of the senior scientists at ADE made me recall JohnTrowbridge’s famous satirical poem on the WrightBrothers, published in 1896:. . . . with thimble and threadAnd wax and hammer, and buckles and screws,And all such things as geniuses use; —Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows.When the project was about a year old, DefenceMinister Krishna Menon made one of his routine visits toADE. I escorted him into our assembly shop. Inside, on atable lay the GEM model broken down into sub-assemblies. The model represented the culmination of oneyear’s untiring efforts to develop a practical hovercraft forbattlefield applications. The minister fired one questionafter another at me, determined to ensure that the prototypewould go into test flight within the coming year. He told DrMediratta, “GEM flight is possible with the gadgets Kalamnow possesses”.The hovercraft was christened Nandi, after the bullridden by Lord Shiva. For a prototype, its form, fit and finishwas beyond our expectation, given the rudimentaryinfrastructure we possessed. I told my colleagues, “Here isa flying machine, not constructed by a bunch of cranks butby engineers of ability. Don’t look at it—it is not made tolook at, but to fly with.”Defence Minister Krishna Menon flew in the Nandi,overruling the accompanying officials’ concern for hissafety. A Group Captain in the minister’s troupe, who hadlogged in many thousands of flying hours, even offered to flythe machine to save the minister from the potential dangerof flying with an inexperienced civilian pilot like myself andgestured to me to come out of the machine. I was sureabout my competence in flying the machine I had made,and therefore shook my head in negation. Observing thiswordless communication, Krishna Menon dismissed theinsulting suggestion of the Group Captain with a laugh andsignalled to me to start the machine. He was very happy.“You have demonstrated that the basic problems ofhovercraft development are solved. Go for a more powerfulprime mover and call me for a second ride,” Krishna Menontold me. The skeptical Group Captain (now Air Marshal)Golay, later became a good friend of mine.We completed the project ahead of schedule. We had aworking hovercraft with us, moving on an air cushion ofabout 40mm with a load of 550kg, including the tare weight.Dr Mediratta was visibly pleased with the achievement. Butby this time, Krishna Menon was out of office and could nottake his promised second ride. In the new order, not manypeople shared his dream with regard to militaryapplications of an indigenous hovercraft. In fact, even'),\n",

I had put my heart and soulinto Nandi. That it would not be used was somethingbeyond my comprehension. I was disappointed anddisillusioned. In this period of confusion and uncertainty,memories from my childhood came back to me and Idiscovered new meanings in them.Pakshi Sastry used to say, “Seek the truth, and the truthshall set you free.” As the Bible says, “Ask and you shallreceive.” It did not happen immediately, but it happenednevertheless. One day, Dr Mediratta called me. He inquiredabout the state of our hovercraft. When told that it was inperfect condition to be flown, he asked me to organize ademonstration for an important visitor the next day. No VIPwas scheduled to visit the laboratory during the next weekas far as I knew. However, I communicated Dr Mediratta’sinstructions to my colleagues and we felt a new surge ofhope.The next day Dr Mediratta brought a visitor to ourhovercraft—a tall, handsome, bearded man. He asked meseveral questions about the machine. I was struck by theobjectivity and clarity of his thinking. “Can you give me aride in the machine?” he enquired. His request filled mewith joy. Finally, here was someone who was interested inmy work.We took a ten-minute ride in the hovercraft, a fewcentimetres above the ground. We were not flying, but weredefinitely floating in the air. The visitor asked me a fewquestions about myself, thanked me for the ride anddeparted. But not before introducing himself—he was Prof.MGK Menon, Director of the Tata Institute of FundamentalResearch (TIFR). After a week, I received a call from theIndian Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), toattend an interview for the post of Rocket Engineer. All Iknew about INCOSPAR at that time was that it was formedout of the TIFR talent pool at Bombay (now Mumbai) toorganize space research in India.I went to Bombay to attend the interview. I was unsureabout the type of questions I would have to face at theinterview. There was hardly any time to read up or talk toany experienced person. Lakshmana Sastry’s voicequoting from the Bhagawad Gita echoed in my ears:All beings are born to delusion . . . overcome by thedualities which arise from wish and hate . . . . But thosemen of virtuous deeds in whom sin has come to an end,freed from the delusion of dualities, worship Me steadfastin their vows.I reminded myself that the best way to win was to notneed to win. The best performances are accomplishedwhen you are relaxed and free of doubt. I decided to takethings as they came. Since neither Prof. MGK Menon’s visitnor the call for an interview had been of my making, Idecided this was the best attitude to take.I was interviewed by Dr Vikram Sarabhai along withProf. MGK Menon and Mr Saraf, then the Deputy Secretaryof the Atomic Energy Commission. As I entered the room, Isensed their warmth and friendliness. I was almostimmediately struck by Dr Sarabhai’s warmth. There wasnone of the arrogance or the patronising attitudes which'),\n",

Dr Sarabhai’s questions did notprobe my existing knowledge or skills; rather they were anexploration of the possibilities I was filled with. He waslooking at me as if in reference to a larger whole. The entireencounter seemed to me a total moment of truth, in whichmy dream was enveloped by the larger dream of a biggerperson.I was advised to stay back for a couple of days.However, the next evening I was told about my selection. Iwas to be absorbed as a rocket engineer at INCOSPAR.This was a breakthrough a young man like myself dreamedof.My work at INCOSPAR commenced with afamiliarization course at the TIFR Computer Centre. Theatmosphere here was remarkably different from that atDTD&P (AIR). Labels mattered very little. There was noneed for anyone to justify his position or to be at thereceiving end of the others’ hostility.Some time in the latter half of 1962, INCOSPAR tookthe decision to set up the Equatorial Rocket LaunchingStation at Thumba, a sleepy fishing village near Trivandrum(now Thiruvananthapuram) in Kerala. Dr Chitnis of thePhysical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad had spotted itas a suitable location as it was very close to the earth’smagnetic equator. This was the quiet beginning of modernrocket-based research in India. The site selected atThumba lay between the railway line and the sea coast,covering a distance of about two and a half km andmeasuring about 600 acres. Within this area, stood a largechurch, whose site had to be acquired. Land acquisitionfrom private parties is always a difficult and time-consuming process, especially in densely populated placeslike Kerala. In addition, there was the delicate matter ofacquiring a site of religious significance. The Collector ofTrivandrum then, K Madhavan Nair, executed this task in amost tactful, peaceful and expeditious manner, with theblessings and cooperation of Right Rev. Dr Dereira, whowas the Bishop of Trivandrum in 1962. Soon RD John, theexecutive engineer of the Central Public Works Department(CPWD), had transformed the entire area. The St. MaryMagdalene church housed the first office of the ThumbaSpace Centre. The prayer room was my first laboratory, theBishop’s room was my design and drawing office. To thisday, the church is maintained in its full glory and, at present,houses the Indian Space Museum.Very soon after this, I was asked to proceed to Americafor a sixmonth training programme on sounding rocketlaunching techniques, at the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration (NASA) work centres. I took sometime off before going abroad and went to Rameswaram.My father was very pleased to learn about the opportunitythat had come my way. He took me to the mosque andorganized a special namaz in thanksgiving. I could feel thepower of God flowing in a circuit through my father to meand back to God; we were all under the spell of the prayer.One of the important functions of prayer, I believe, is toact as a stimulus to creative ideas. Within the mind are allthe resources required for successful living. Ideas arepresent in the consciousness, which when released andgiven scope to grow and take shape, can lead tosuccessful events. God, our Creator, has stored within ourminds and personalities, great potential strength andability. Prayer helps us to tap and develop these powers.Ahmed Jallaluddin and Samsuddin came to see me offat Bombay airport. It was their first exposure to a big city'),\n",

This is primarily anR&D centre for advanced aerospace technology. One ofmy most vivid memoriesof LRC is of a piece of sculpture depicting a charioteerdriving two horses, one representing scientific researchand the other technological development, metaphoricallyencapsulating the interconnection between research anddevelopment.From LRC I went to the Goddard Space Flight Centre(GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. This Centre develops andmanages most of NASA’s earth-orbiting science andapplications satellites. It operates NASA’s trackingnetworks for all space missions. Towards the end of myvisit, I went to the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island inEast Coast, Virginia. This place was the base for NASA’ssounding rocket programme. Here, I saw a paintingprominently displayed in the reception lobby. It depicted abattle scene with a few rockets flying in the background. Apainting with this theme should be the most commonplacething at a Flight Facility, but the painting caught my eyebecause the soldiers on the side launching the rocketswere not white, but dark-skinned, with the racial features ofpeople found in South Asia. One day, my curiosity got thebetter of me, drawing me towards the painting. It turned outto be Tipu Sultan’s army fighting the British. The paintingdepicted a fact forgotten in Tipu’s own country butcommemorated here on the other side of the planet. I washappy to see an Indian glorified by NASA as a hero ofwarfare rocketry.My impression of the American people can besummarized by a quotation from Benjamin Franklin, “Thosethings that hurt instruct!” I realised that people in this part ofthe world meet their problems head on. They attempt to getout of them rather than suffer them.My mother had once narrated an incident from the HolyBook— after God created man, he asked the angels toprostrate themselves before Adam. Everybody prostratedthemselves except Iblis, or Satan, who refused. “Why didyou not prostrate yourself?” Allah asked. “You created meof fire and him of clay. Does not that make me nobler thanAdam?” Satan contended. God said, “Be gone fromparadise! This is no place for your contemptuous pride.”Satan obeyed, but not before cursing Adam with the samefate. Soon Adam followed suit by becoming a transgressorafter eating the forbidden fruit. Allah said, “Go hence andmay your descendants live a life of doubt and mistrust.”What makes life in Indian organizations difficult is thewidespread prevalence of this very contemptuous pride. Itstops us from listening to our juniors, subordinates andpeople down the line. You cannot expect a person to deliverresults if you humiliate him, nor can you expect him to becreative if you abuse him or despise him. The line betweenfirmness and harshness, between strong leadership andbullying, between discipline and vindictiveness is very fine,but it has to be drawn. Unfortunately, the only lineprominently drawn in our country today is between the‘heroes’ and the ‘zeros’. On one side are a few hundred‘heroes’ keeping nine hundred and fifty million people downon the other side. This situation has to be changed.As the process of confronting and solving problemsoften requires hard work and is painful, we have endless'),\n",

The rocket wasassembled in the church building I have referred to earlier.The only equipment available to transport the rocket was atruck and a manually operated hydraulic crane. Theassembled rocket was to be shifted from the churchbuilding to the launch pad by truck. When the rocket waslifted by the crane and was about to be placed on thelauncher, it started tilting, indicating a leak in the hydraulicsystem of the crane. As we were fast approaching thelaunch time, 6 p.m., any repairs to the crane had to be ruledout. Fortunately, the leak was not large and we managed tolift the rocket manually, using our collective muscle powerand finally placing it on the launcher.In the maiden Nike-Apache launch, I was in charge ofrocket integration and safety. Two of my colleagues whoplayed a very active and crucial role in this launch were DEaswardas and R Aravamudan. Easwardas undertook therocket assembly and arranged the launch. Aravamudan,whom we called Dan, was in charge of radar, telemetry andground support. The launch was smooth and problemfree.We obtained excellent flight data and returned with a senseof pride and accomplishment.When we were relaxing the next evening at the dinnertable, we received news of the assassination of PresidentJohn F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. We were appalled. TheKennedy years were a significant era in America, whenyoung men were at the helm of affairs. I used to read withinterest about Kennedy’s moves in the missile crisis of late1962. The Soviet Union built missile sites in Cuba, fromwhich it would have been possible to launch attacks onAmerican cities. Kennedy imposed a blockade or‘quarantine’, barring the introduction of any offensivemissiles to Cuba. America also threatened to respond toany Soviet nuclear attack from Cuba on any country in theWestern Hemisphere by retaliating against the USSR. Afterfourteen days of intense drama, the crisis was resolved bythe Soviet Premier Khrushchev ordering that the Cubanbases be dismantled and the missiles returned to Russia.The next day, Prof. Sarabhai had a detailed discussionwith us on future plans. He was creating a new frontier inthe field of science and technology in India. A newgeneration, scientists and engineers in their 30s and early40s, was being charged with an unprecedented dynamism.Our biggest qualifications at INCOSPAR were not ourdegrees and training, but Prof. Sarabhai’s faith in ourcapabilities. After the successful launch of Nike-Apache, hechose to share with us his dream of an Indian SatelliteLaunch Vehicle.Prof. Sarabhai’s optimism was highly contagious. Thevery news of his coming to Thumba would electrify peopleand all laboratories, workshops and design offices wouldhum with unceasing activity. People would work virtuallyround the clock because of their enthusiasm to show Prof.Sarabhai something new, something that had not beendone before in our country—be it a new design or a newmethod of fabrication or even an out-of-the-wayadministrative procedure. Prof. Sarabhai would oftenassign multiple tasks to a single person or a group. Thoughsome of those tasks would appear totally unrelated in thebeginning, they would, at a later stage, emerge as deeplyinterconnected. When Prof. Sarabhai was talking to us'),\n",

I knew that all I had to do was toremain alert and focussed on my purpose, and sooner orlater, an opportunity to do a challenging job would enter mylaboratory.Prof. Sarabhai was ever-willing to try out novelapproaches and liked to draw in young people. He had thewisdom and judgement which enabled him to realise notonly if something was well done, but also when it was timeto stop. In my opinion, he was an ideal experimenter andinnovator. When there were alternative courses of actionbefore us, whose outcome was difficult to predict, or toreconcile varying perspectives, Prof. Sarabhai would resortto experimentation to resolve the issue. This was preciselythe situation at INCOSPAR in 1963. A bunch of young,inexperienced, but nevertheless energetic and enthusiasticpersons were given the task of fleshing out the spirit ofselfreliance in the field of science and technology ingeneral, and of space research in particular. It was a greatexample of leadership by trust.The rocket launch site later blossomed into the ThumbaEquatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS). TERLS wasestablished through active collaboration with France, USAand USSR. The leader of the Indian space programme—Prof. Vikram Sarabhai—had comprehended the fullimplications of the challenge and had not balked at taking iton. Right from the day INCOSPAR was formed, he wasaware of the need to organize an integrated national spaceprogramme, with the equipment for the manufacture ofrockets and launch facilities developed and producedindigenously.With this in view, a wide-ranging programme forscientific and technological development in rocket fuels,propulsion systems, aeronautics, aerospace materials,advanced fabrication techniques, rocket motorinstrumentation, control and guidance systems, telemetry,tracking systems and scientific instruments forexperimentation in space were launched at the SpaceScience and Technology Centre and the PhysicalResearch Laboratory at Ahmedabad. Incidentally, thislaboratory has produced a large number of Indian spacescientists of extremely high calibre over the years.The real journey of the Indian aerospace programme,however, had begun with the Rohini Sounding Rocket(RSR) Programme. What is it that distinguishes a soundingrocket from a Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and from amissile? In fact, they are three different kinds of rockets.Sounding rockets are normally used for probing the near-earth environment, including the upper regions of theatmosphere. While they can carry a variety of scientificpayloads to a range of altitudes, they cannot impart the finalvelocity needed to orbit the payload. On the other hand, alaunch vehicle is designed to inject into orbit atechnological payload or satellite. The final stage of alaunch vehicle provides the necessary velocity for a satelliteto enter an orbit. This is a complex operation requiring on-board guidance and control systems. A missile, thoughbelonging to the same family, is a still more complexsystem. In addition to the large terminal velocity andonboard guidance and control, it must have the capability tohome onto targets. When the targets are fast-moving andcapable of manoeuvring, a missile is also required to carry'),\n",

Under this programme, a family of operationalsounding rockets were developed. These rockets had wideranging capabilities, and to date several hundreds of theserockets have been launched for various scientific andtechnological studies.I still remember that the first Rohini rocket consisted of asingle solid propulsion motor weighing a mere 32 kg. Itlifted a nominal 7 kg payload to an altitude of about 10 km.It was soon followed by another, to which one more solidpropellant stage was added to dispatch multi-experimentpayloads weighing nearly 100 kg to an altitude of over 350km.The development of these rockets had resulted in a fullyindigenous capability in the production of sounding rocketsas well as their propellants. This programme had broughtinto the country technology for the production of very high-performance solid propellants, like those based onpolyurethane and polybutane polymer. It later resulted in thesetting up of a Propellant Fuel Complex (PFC) tomanufacture strategic chemicals required for rocketengines, and a Rocket Propellant Plant (RPP) to producepropellants.The development of Indian rockets in the twentiethcentury can be seen as a revival of the eighteenth centurydream of Tipu Sultan. When Tipu Sultan was killed, theBritish captured more than 700 rockets and subsystems of900 rockets in the battle of Turukhanahally in 1799. Hisarmy had 27 brigades, called Kushoons, and each brigadehad a company of rocket men, called Jourks. Theserockets had been taken to England by William Congreveand were subjected by the British to what we call ‘reverseengineering’ today. There were, of course, no GATT, IPRAct, or patent regime. With the death of Tipu, Indianrocketry also met its demise—at least for 150 years.Meanwhile, rocket technology made great stridesabroad. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in Russia (1903), RobertGoddard in USA (1914) and Hermann Oberth in Germany(1923) gave rocketry new dimensions. In Nazi Germany,Wernher von Braun’s group produced V-2 short rangeballistic missiles and showered fire on the Allied Forces.After the war, both the USA and the USSR captured theirshare of German rocket technology and rocket engineers.With this booty, they started to run their deadly arms racewith missiles and warheads.Rocketry was reborn in India thanks to the technologicalvision of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Prof. Sarabhaitook the challenge of giving physical dimensions to thisdream. Very many individuals with myopic visionquestioned the relevance of space activities in a newlyindependent nation which was finding it difficult to feed itspopulation. But neither Prime Minister Nehru nor Prof.Sarabhai had any ambiguity of purpose. Their vision wasvery clear: if Indians were to play a meaningful role in thecommunity of nations, they must be second to none in theapplication of advanced technologies to their real-lifeproblems. They had no intention of using it merely as ameans to display our might.* * *'),\n",

He never gave directions. Rather, through a freeexchangeof views, he led us forward into new terrain which oftenrevealed an unforeseen solution. Perhaps he was awarethat though a particular goal might be clear to himself, andhe could give adequate directions for its accomplishment,his team members might have resisted working towards agoal that made no sense to them. He considered thecollective understanding of the problem the main attributeof effective leadership. He once told me, “Look, my job is tomake decisions; but it is equally important to see to it thatthese decisions are accepted by my team members.”In fact, Prof. Sarabhai took a series of decisions thatwere to become the life-mission of many. We would makeour own rockets, our own Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLVs)and our own satellites. And this would not be done one-by-one but concurrently, in a multi-dimensional fashion. In thedevelopment of payloads for the sounding rockets, insteadof getting a certain payload and then engineering it to fitinto the rocket, we discussed the matter threadbare withthe payload scientists working in different organ-izationsand at different locations. I may even say that the mostsignificant achievement of the sounding rocket programmewas to establish and maintain nation-wide mutual trust.Perhaps realising that I preferred to persuade people todo as they were told rather than use my legitimate authority,Prof. Sarabhai assigned me the task of providing interfacesupport to payload scientists. Almost all physicallaboratories in India were involved in the sounding rocketprogramme, each having its own mission, its own objectiveand its own payload. These payloads were required to beintegrated to the rocket structure so as to ensure theirproper functioning and endurance under flight conditions.We had X-ray payloads to look at stars; payloads fitted withradio frequency mass spectrometers to analyse the gascomposition of the upper atmosphere; sodium payloads tofind out wind conditions, its direction and velocity. We alsohad ionospheric payloads to explore different layers of theatmosphere. I not only had to interact with scientists fromTIFR, National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and PhysicalResearch Laboratory (PRL), but also with payloadscientists from USA, USSR, France, Germany and Japan.I often read Khalil Gibran, and always find his words fullof wisdom. “Bread baked without love is a bitter bread thatfeeds but half a man’s hunger,”—those who cannot workwith their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted successthat breeds bitterness all around. If you are a writer whowould secretly prefer to be a lawyer or a doctor, your writtenwords will feed but half the hunger of your readers; if youare a teacher who would rather be a businessman, yourinstructions will meet but half the need for knowledge ofyour students; if you are a scientist who hates science, yourperformance will satisfy but half the needs of your mission.The personal unhappiness and failure to achieve resultsthat comes from being a round peg in a square hole is not,by any means, new. But there are exceptions to this likeProf. Oda and Sudhakar, who bring to their work a personaltouch of magic based upon their individual character,personality, inner motives, and perhaps the dreamscrystallized within their hearts.

I remember him as a diminutive man with a toweringpersonality and eyes that radiated intelligence. Hisdedication to his work was exemplary. He would bring X-ray payloads from ISAS, which along with the X-raypayloads made by Prof. UR Rao, would be engineered bymy team to fit into the nose cone of the Rohini Rocket. Atan altitude of 150 km, the nose cone would be separatedby explosion of pyros triggered by an electronic timer. Withthis, the X-ray sensors would be exposed to space forcollecting the required information about the emissionsfrom stars. Together, Prof. Oda and Prof. Rao were aunique blend of intellect and dedication, which one rarelysees. One day, when I was working on the integration forProf. Oda’s payload with my timer devices, he insisted onusing the timers he had brought from Japan. To me theylooked flimsy, but Prof. Oda stuck to his stand that theIndian timers be replaced by the Japanese ones. I yieldedto his suggestion and replaced the timers. The rocket tookoff elegantly and attained the intended altitude. But thetelemetry signal reported mission failure on account oftimer malfunction. Prof. Oda was so upset that tears welledup in his eyes. I was stunned by the emotional intensity ofProf. Oda’s response. He had clearly put his heart and soulinto his work.Sudhakar was my colleague in the Payload PreparationLaboratory. As part of the pre-launch schedule, we werefilling and remotely pressing the hazardous sodium andthermite mix. As usual, it was a hot and humid day atThumba. After the sixth such operation, Sudhakar and Iwent into the payload room to confirm the proper filling ofthe mix. Suddenly, a drop of sweat from his forehead fellonto the sodium, and before we knew what was happening,there was a violent explosion which shook the room. For afew paralysed seconds, I did not know what to do. The firewas spreading, and water would not extinguish the sodiumfire. Trapped in this inferno, Sudhakar, however, did notlose his presence of mind. He broke the glass window withhis bare hands and literally threw me out to safety beforejumping out himself. I touched Sudhakar’s bleeding handsin gratitude, he was smiling through his pain. Sudhakarspent many weeks in the hospital recuperating from thesevere burns he had received.At TERLS, I was involved with rocket preparationactivities, payload assembly, testing and evaluationbesides building subsystems like payload housing andjettisonable nose cones. Working with the nose cones ledme, as a natural consequence, into the field of compositematerials.It is interesting to know that the bows found, duringarchaeological excavations at different sites in the country,reveal that Indians used composite bows made of wood,sinew, and horn as early as the eleventh century, at least500 years before such bows were made in medievalEurope. The versatility of composites, in the sense that theypossess very desirable structural, thermal, electrical,chemical and mechanical properties, fascinated me. I wasso enthused with these man-made materials that I was in ahurry to know everything about them almost overnight. Iused to read up everything available on related topics. Iwas particularly interested in the glass and carbon FibreReinforced Plastic (FRP) composites.An FRP composite is composed of an inorganic fibre'),\n",

In February 1969, Prime MinisterIndira Gandhi visited Thumba to dedicate TERLS to theInternational Space Science Community. On this occasion,she commissioned the country’s first filament windingmachine in our laboratory. This event brought my team,which included CR Satya, PN Subramanian and MNSatyanara-yana, great satisfaction. We made highstrengthglass cloth laminates to build non-magnetic payloadhousings and flew them in two-stage sounding rockets. Wealso wound and test flew rocket motor casings of up to 360mm diameter.Slowly, but surely, two Indian rockets were born atThumba. They were christened Rohini and Menaka, afterthe two mythological dancers in the court of Indra, the kingof the sky. The Indian payloads no longer needed to belaunched by French rockets. Could this have been done butfor the atmosphere of trust and commitment which Prof.Sarabhai had created at INCOSPAR? He brought into useeach person’s knowledge and skills. He made every manfeel directly involved in problem solving. By the very fact ofthe team members’ participation, the solutions becamegenuine and earned the trust of the entire team resulting intotal commitment towards implementation.Prof. Sarabhai was matter-of-fact and never tried tohide his disappointment. He used to talk with us in anhonest and objective manner. Sometimes I found himmaking things look more positive than they actually were,and then charming us by his almost magical powers ofpersuasion. When we were at the drawing board, he wouldbring someone from the developed world for a technicalcollaboration. That was his subtle way of challenging eachone of us to stretch our capabilities.At the same time, even if we failed to meet certainobjectives, he would praise whatever we hadaccomplished. Whenever he found any one of us goingover his head and attempting a task for which he did nothave the capability or skill, Prof. Sarabhai would reassignactivity in such a way so as to lower pressure and permitbetter quality work to be performed. By the time the firstRohini-75 rocket was launched from TERLS on 20November 1967, almost each one of us was in his owngroove.Early next year, Prof. Sarabhai wanted to see meurgently in Delhi. By now I was accustomed to Prof.Sarabhai’s working methods. He was always full ofenthusiasm and optimism. In such a state of mind, suddenflashes of inspiration were almost natural. On reachingDelhi, I contacted Prof. Sarabhai’s secretary for anappointment and was asked to meet him at 3.30 a.m. atHotel Ashoka. Delhi being a slightly unfamiliar place, withan unfriendly climate for someone like me, conditioned tothe warm and humid climate of South India, I decided towait in the hotel lounge after finishing my dinner.I have always been a religious person in the sense that Imaintain a working partnership with God.

In this partnership, Ihave always received all the power I needed, and in facthave actually felt it flowing through me.

Without theslightest warning, something new breaks into your life and asecret decision is taken, a decision that you may becompletely unconscious of, to start with.I looked around the elegant lounge. Somebody had lefta book on a nearby sofa. As if to fill the small hours of thatcold night with some warm thoughts, I picked up the bookand started browsing. I must have turned only a few pagesof the book, about which I do not remember a thing today.It was some popular book related to businessmanagement. I was not really reading it, only skimming overparagraphs and turning pages. Suddenly, my eyes fell on apassage in the book, it was a quotation from GeorgeBernard Shaw. The gist of the quote was that allreasonable men adapt themselves to the world. Only a fewunreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world tothemselves. All progress in the world depends on theseunreasonable men and their innovative and oftennonconformist actions.I started reading the book from the Bernard Shawpassage onwards. The author was describing certainmyths woven around the concept and the process ofinnovation in industry and business. I read about the myth ofstrategic planning. It is generally believed that substantialstrategic and technological planning greatly increases theodds of a ‘no surprises’ outcome. The author was of theopinion that it is essential for a project manager to learn tolive with uncertainty and ambiguity. He felt that it was a mythto hold that the key to economic success is computability. Aquotation from General George Patton was given as acounterpoint to this myth—that a good plan violentlyexecuted right now is far better than a perfect planexecuted next week. It is a myth that to win big one muststrive to optimize, the author felt. Optimization wins only onpaper, but would invariably lose later in the real world, thebook said.Waiting in the hotel lobby at 1 a.m. for an appointmenttwo hours later was certainly not a reasonable proposition,neither for me nor for Prof. Sarabhai. But then, Prof.Sarabhai had always exhibited a strong component ofunorthodoxy in his character. He was running the show ofspace research in the country—under-staffed, overworked— nevertheless in a successful manner.Suddenly, I became aware of another man who cameand sat down on the sofa opposite mine. He was a well-built person with an intelligent look and refined posture.Unlike me—always disorderly in my dress— this man waswearing elegant clothes. Notwithstanding the odd hours, hewas alert and vivacious.There was a strange magnetism about him whichderailed the train of my thoughts on innovation. And before Icould get back to the book, I was informed that Prof.Sarabhai was ready to receive me. I left the book on thenearby sofa from where I had picked it up. I was surprisedwhen the man sitting on the opposite sofa was also askedto come inside. Who was he? It was not long before myquestion was answered.

But as soon as wefinished the coffee, Prof. Sarabhai rose and asked us toaccompany him to Tilpat Range on the outskirts of Delhi.As we were passing through the lobby, I threw a cursoryglance at the sofa where I had left the book. It was not there.It was about an hour’s drive to the Range. Prof.Sarabhai showed us a Russian RATO. “If I get you themotors of this system from Russia, could you do it ineighteen months time?” Prof. Sarabhai asked us. “Yes, wecan!” Both Gp Capt VS Narayanan and I spoke almostsimultaneously. Prof. Sarabhai’s face beamed, reflectingour fascination. I recalled what I had read, “He will bestowon you a light to walk in.”After dropping us back at the Hotel Ashoka, Prof.Sarabhai went to the Prime Minister’s house for abreakfast meeting. By that evening, the news of India takingup the indigenous development of a device to help short runtake-offs by high performance military aircraft, with myselfheading the project, was made public. I was filled with manyemotions— happiness, gratitude, a sense of fulfilment andthese lines from a littleknown poet of the nineteenth-centurycrossed my mind:For all your days prepareAnd meet them ever alikeWhen you are the anvil, bear –When you are the hammer, strike.RATO motors were mounted on aircraft to provide theadditional thrust required during the take-off run undercertain adverse operating conditions like partially bombed-out runways, high altitude airfields, more than theprescribed load, or very high ambient temperatures. TheAir Force was in dire need of a large number of RATOmotors for their S22 and HF-24 aircraft.The Russian RATO motor shown to us at the TilpatRange was capable of generating a 3000 kg thrust with atotal impulse of 24500 kgseconds. It weighed 220 kg andhad a double base propellant encased in steel. Thedevelopment work was to be carried out at the SpaceScience and Technology Centre with the assistance of theDefence Research and Development Organization(DRDO), HAL, DTD&P(Air) and Air Headquarters.After a detailed analysis of the available options, Ichose a fibreglass motor casing. We decided in favour of acomposite propellant which gives a higher specific impulseand aimed at a longer burning time to utilize it completely. Ialso decided to take additional safety measures byincorporating a diaphragm which would rupture if thechamber pressure for some reason exceeded twice theoperating pressure. Two significant developments occurredduring the work on RATO. The first was the release of aten-year profile for space research in the country, preparedby Prof. Sarabhai. This profile was not merely an activityplan laid down by the top man for his team to comply with, itwas a theme paper meant for open discussions, to be latertransformed into a programme. In fact, I found it was theromantic manifesto of a person deeply in love with thespace research programme in his country.The plan mainly centred around the early ideas whichhad been born at INCOSPAR; it included utilization ofsatellites for television and developmental education,meteorological observations and remote sensing for'),\n",

To this had been addedthe development and launch of satellite launch vehicles.The active international cooperation dominant in theearly years was virtually eased out in this plan and theemphasis was on self-reliance and indigenoustechnologies. The plan talked about the realisation of aSLV for injecting lightweight satellites into a low earth orbit,upgrading of Indian satellites from laboratory models tospace entities and development of a wide range ofspacecraft subsystems like the apogee and boostermotors, momentum wheel, and solar panel deploymentmechanism. It also promised a wide range of technologicalspin-offs like the gyros, various types of transducers,telemetry, adhesives, and polymers for non-spaceapplications. Over and above, there was the dream of anadequate infrastructure that would be capable of supportingR&D in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.The second development was the formation of a MissilePanel in the Ministry of Defence. Both Narayanan and Iwere inducted as members. The idea of making missiles inour own country was exciting, and we spent hours on endstudying the missiles of various advanced countries.The distinction between a tactical missile and astrategic missile is often a fine one. Generally, by‘strategic’, it is understood that the missile will fly thousandsof kilometres. However, in warfare, this term is used todenote the kind of target rather than its distance frommissile launch. Strategic missiles are those that strike atthe enemy’s heartland, either in counter-force attacks ontheir strategic forces or in counter-value attacks on thesociety, which in essence means his cities. Tacticalweapons are those that influence a battle, and the battlemay be by land, sea or air, or on all three together. Thiscategorization now appears nonsensical, as the US AirForce’s ground-launched Tomahawk is used in a tacticalrole, notwithstanding its range of some 3000 km. In thosedays, however, strategic missiles were synonymous withintermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) with ranges inthe order of 1500 nautical miles or 2780 km and inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a capability ofgoing even further.Gp Capt Narayanan had an ineffable enthusiasm forindigenous guided missiles. He was a great admirer of thestrong arm approach of the Russian Missile DevelopmentProgramme. “When it could be done there, why not here,where space research has already prepared the soil for abonanza of missile technology?” Narayanan used to needleme.The bitter lessons of the two wars in 1962 and 1965had left the Indian leadership with little choice in the matterof achieving self-reliance in military hardware and weaponsystems. A large number of Surfaceto-Air Missiles (SAMs)were obtained from the USSR to guard strategic locations.Gp Capt Narayanan passionately advocated thedevelopment of these missiles in the country.While working together on RATO motors and on theMissile Panel, Narayanan and I played the roles of studentand teacher interchangeably wherever required. He wasvery eager to learn about rocketry and I was very curious toknow about airborne weapon systems. The depth ofNarayanan’s conviction and his force of application wereinspiring. Right from the day of our pre-dawn visit to theTilpat Range with Prof. Sarabhai, Narayanan was alwaysbusy with his RATO motor. He had arranged everything thatwas required before being asked. He obtained funding ofRs 75 lakhs with a further commitment towards any'),\n",

Babuhad joined us a few months ago and the only thing I knewabout him was that he had a very positive attitude and wasarticulate. I called him into my office and did a bit of loudthinking. “Do you have any suggestions?” I then asked him.Babu remained silent for a while, and then asked for timeuntil the next evening to do some homework beforeanswering my question.The next evening, Babu came to me before theappointed time. His face was beaming with promise. “Wecan do it, sir! The RATO system can be made withoutimports. The only hurdle is the inherent inelasticity in theapproach of the organization towards procurement andsubcontracting, which would be the two major thrust areasto avoid imports.” He gave me seven points, or, rather,asked for seven liberties—financial approval by a singleperson instead of an entire hierarchy, air travel for allpeople on work irrespective of their entitlement,accountability to only one person, lifting of goods by air-cargo, sub-contracting to the private sector, placement oforders on the basis of technical competence, andexpeditious accounting procedures.These demands were unheard of in governmentestablishments, which tend to be conservative, yet I couldsee the soundness of his proposition. The RATO projectwas a new game and there was nothing wrong if it was tobe played with a new set of rules. I weighed all the pros andcons of Babu’s suggestions for a whole night and finallydecided to present them to Prof. Sarabhai. Hearing myplea for administrative liberalization and seeing the meritsbehind it, Prof. Sarabhai approved the proposals without asecond thought.Through his suggestions, Babu had highlighted theimportance of business acumen in developmental workwith high stakes. To make things move faster withinexisting work parameters, you have to pump in morepeople, more material and more money. If you can’t do that,change your parameters! Instinctive businessman that hewas, Babu did not remain long with us and left ISRO forgreener pastures in Nigeria. I could never forget Babu’scommon sense in financial matters.We had opted for a composite structure for the RATOmotor casing using filament fibre glass/epoxy. We had alsogone in for a high energy composite propellant and anevent-based ignition and jettisoning system in real-time. Acanted nozzle was designed to deflect the jet away from theaircraft.

Recognising the immense socio-economic benefits of space technology, Prof. Sarabhaidecided in 1969, to go full-steam ahead with the task ofestablishing indigenous capability in building and launchingour own satellites. He personally participated in an aerialsurvey of the east coast for a possible site for launchingsatellite launch vehicles and large rockets.Prof. Sarabhai was concentrating on the east coast inorder to let the launch vehicle take full advantage of theearth’s west to east rotation. He finally selected theSriharikota island, 100 km north of Madras (now Chennai),and thus the SHAR Rocket Launch Station was born. Thecrescent-shaped island has a maximum width of 8 km andlies alongside the coastline. The island is as big as Madrascity. The Buckingham Canal and the Pulicat lake form itswestern boundary.In 1968, we had formed the Indian Rocket Society.Soon after, the INCOSPAR was reconstituted as anadvisory body under the Indian National Science Academy(INSA) and the Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO) was created under the Department of AtomicEnergy (DAE) to conduct space research in the country.By this time, Prof. Sarabhai had already hand-picked ateam to give form to his dream of an Indian SLV. I considermyself fortunate to have been chosen to be a projectleader. Prof. Sarabhai gave me the additionalresponsibility of designing the fourth stage of the SLV. DrVR Gowarikar, MR Kurup and AE Muthunayagam weregiven the tasks of designing the other three stages.What made Prof. Sarabhai pick a few of us for thisgreat mission? One reason seemed to be our professionalbackground. Dr Gowarikar was doing outstanding work inthe field of composite propellants. MR Kurup hadestablished an excellent laboratory for propellants,propulsion and pyrotechnics. Muthunayagam had provedhimself in the field of high energy propellants. The fourthstage was to be a composite structure and called for alarge number of innovations in fabrication technology;perhaps that was why I was brought in.I laid the foundation for Stage IV on two rocks—sensibleapproximation and unawed support. I have alwaysconsidered the price of perfection prohibitive and allowedmistakes as a part of the learning process. I prefer a dashof daring and persistence to perfection. I have alwayssupported learning on the part of my team members bypaying vigilant attention to each of their attempts, be theysuccessful or unsuccessful.In my group, progress was recognized and reinforced atevery tiny step. Although I provided access to all theinformation that my co-workers in Stage IV needed, I found Icould not spend enough time to be a useful facilitator and asource of support. I wondered if there was somethingwrong with the way in which I managed my time. At thisstage, Prof. Sarabhai brought a French visitor to our workcentre to point out the problem to me. This gentleman wasProf. Curien, President of CNES (Centre Nationale deEtudes Spatiales), our counterpart in France. They werethen developing the Diamont launch vehicles. Prof. Curienwas a thorough professional. Together, Prof. Sarabhai andProf. Curien helped me set a target. While they discussedthe means by which I could reach it, they also cautioned meabout the possibilities of failure. While I arrived at a better'),\n",

He was so impressedby our well-planned efforts that he inquired if we couldmake the Diamont’s fourth stage. I recall how this brought asubtle smile to Prof. Sarabhai’s face.As a matter of fact, the Diamont and SLV airframeswere incompatible. The diameters were quite different andto attain interchangeability, some radical innovations wererequired. I wondered where I should start. I decided to lookaround for solutions among my own colleagues. I used tocarefully observe my colleagues to see if their daily routinereflected their desire to constantly experiment. I also startedasking and listening to anyone who showed the slightestpromise. Some of my friends cautioned me about what theytermed as my naivete. I made it an unfailing routine to makenotes on individual suggestions and gave handwrittennotes to colleagues in engineering and design, requestingconcrete follow-up action within five or ten days.This method worked wonderfully well. Prof. Curientestified, while reviewing our progress, that we hadachieved in a year’s time what our counterparts in Europecould barely manage in three years. Our plus point, henoted, was that each of us worked with those below andabove in the hierarchy. I made it a point to have the teammeet at least once every week. Though it took up time andenergy, I considered it essential.How good is a leader? No better than his people andtheir commitment and participation in the project as fullpartners! The fact that I got them all together to sharewhatever little development had been achieved— results,experiences, small successes, and the like—seemed tome worth putting all my energy and time into. It was a verysmall price to pay for that commitment and sense ofteamwork, which could in fact be called trust. Within my ownsmall group of people I found leaders, and learned thatleaders exist at every level. This was another importantaspect of management that I learned.We had modified the existing SLV-IV Stage design tosuit the Diamont airframe. It was reconfigured andupgraded from a 250 kg, 400 mm diameter stage to a 600kg, 650 mm diameter stage. After two years’ effort, whenwe were about to deliver it to CNES, the French suddenlycancelled their Diamont BC programme. They told us thatthey did not need our Stage IV anymore. It was a greatshock, making me re-live the earlier disappointments atDehra Dun, when I failed to get into the Air Force, and atBangalore, when the Nandi project was aborted at ADE.I had invested great hope and effort in the fourth stage,so that it could be flown with a Diamont rocket. The otherthree stages of SLV, involving enormous work in the areaof rocket propulsion were at least five years away.However, it did not take me long to shelve thedisappointment of Diamont BC Stage IV. After all, I hadthoroughly enjoyed working on this project. In time, RATOfilled the vacuum created in me by the Diamont BC Stage.When the RATO project was underway, the SLV projectslowly started taking shape. Competence for all majorsystems of a launch vehicle had been established inThumba by now. Through their outstanding efforts, VasantGowarikar, MR Kurup and Muthunayagam preparedTERLS for a big leap in rocketry.'),\n",

Two men werecompetent to carry out this task—one was the seasonedand sophisticated UR Rao and the other was a relativelyunknown experimenter, G Madhavan Nair. Although I wasdeeply impressed by Madhavan Nair’s dedication andabilities, I did not rate his chances as very good. Duringone of Prof. Sarabhai’s routine visits, Madhavan Nair boldlydemonstrated his improvised but highly reliabletelecommand system. Prof. Sarabhai did not take muchtime to back the young experimenter in preference to anestablished expert. Madhavan Nair not only lived up to theexpectations of his leader but even went beyond them. Hewas to later become the project director of the PolarSatellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).SLVs and missiles can be called first cousins: they aredifferent in concept and purpose, but come from the samebloodline of rocketry. A massive missile developmentproject had been taken up by DRDO at the DefenceResearch & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad.As the pace of this surface-to-air missile developmentproject increased, the frequency of the Missile Panelmeetings and my interaction with Gp Capt Narayanan alsoincreased.In 1968, Prof. Sarabhai came to Thumba on one of hisroutine visits. He was shown the operation of the nose-conejettisoning mechanism. As always, we were all anxious toshare the results of our work with Prof. Sarabhai. Werequested Prof. Sarabhai to formally activate the pyrosystem through a timer circuit. Prof. Sarabhai smiled, andpressed the button. To our horror, nothing happened. Wewere dumbstruck. I looked at Pramod Kale, who haddesigned and integrated the timer circuit. In a flash each ofus mentally went through an anlysis of the failure. Werequested Prof. Sarabhai to wait for a few minutes, then wedetached the timer device, giving direct connection to thepyros. Prof. Sarabhai pressed the button again. The pyroswere fired and the nose cone was jettisoned. Prof.Sarabhai congratulated Kale and me; but his expressionsuggested that his thoughts were elsewhere. We could notguess what was on his mind. The suspense did not last forlong and I got a call from Prof. Sarabhai’s secretary to meethim after dinner for an important discussion.Prof. Sarabhai was staying at the Kovalam PalaceHotel, his usual home whenever he was in Trivandrum. Iwas slightly perplexed by the summons. Prof. Sarabhaigreeted me with his customary warmth. He talked of therocket launching station, envisaging facilities like launchpads, block houses, radar, telemetry and so on—thingswhich are taken for granted in Indian space research today.Then he brought up the incident that had occurred thatmorning. This was exactly what I had feared. Myapprehension of a reproach from my leader, however, wasunfounded. Prof. Sarabhai did not conclude that the failureof the pyro timer circuit was the outcome of insufficientknowledge and lack of skill on the part of his people or offaulty understanding at the direction stage. He asked meinstead, if we were unenthused by a job that did not posesufficient challenge. He also asked me to consider if mywork was possibly being affected by any problem of which Iwas hitherto unaware. He finally put his finger on the keyissue. We lacked a single roof to carry out systemintegration of all our rocket stages and rocket systems.'),\n",

He was not especially concerned with themistake in the timer circuit, least of all with pinning theblame for it. Prof. Sarabhai’s approach to mistakes restedon the assumption that they were inevitable but generallymanageable. It was in the handling of the crises that aroseas a consequence that talent could often be revealed. I laterrealised by experience, that the best way to prevent errorswas to anticipate them. But this time, by a strange twist offate, the failure of the timer circuit led to the birth of a rocketengineering laboratory.It was my usual practice to brief Prof. Sarabhai afterevery Missile Panel Meeting. After attending one suchmeeting in Delhi on 30 December 1971, I was returning toTrivandrum. Prof. Sarabhai was visiting Thumba that veryday to review the SLV design. I spoke to him on thetelephone from the airport lounge about the salient pointsthat had emerged at the panel meeting. He instructed me towait at Trivandrum Airport after disembarking from theDelhi flight, and to meet him there before his departure forBombay the same night.When I reached Trivandrum, a pall of gloom hung in theair. The aircraft ladder operator Kutty told me in a chokedvoice that Prof. Sarabhai was no more. He had passedaway a few hours ago, following a cardiac arrest. I wasshocked to the core; it had happened within an hour of ourconversation. It was a great blow to me and a huge loss toIndian science. That night passed in preparations forairlifting Prof. Sarabhai’s body for the cremation inAhmedabad.For five years, between 1966 to 1971, about 22scientists and engineers had worked closely with Prof.Sarabhai. All of them were later to take charge of importantscientific projects. Not only was Prof. Sarabhai a greatscientist, but also a great leader. I still remember himreviewing the bi-monthly progress of the design projects ofSLV-3 in June 1970. Presentations on Stages I to IV werearranged. The first three presentations went throughsmoothly. Mine was the last presentation. I introduced fiveof my team members who had contributed in various waysto the design. To everybody’s surprise, each of thempresented his portion of the work with authority andconfidence. The presentations were discussed at lengthand the conclusion was that satisfactory progress had beenmade.Suddenly, a senior scientist who worked closely withProf. Sarabhai turned to me and enquired, “Well, thepresentations for your project were made by your teammembers based on their work. But what did you do for theproject?” That was the first time I saw Prof. Sarabhai reallyannoyed. He told his colleague, “You ought to know whatproject management is all about. We just witnessed anexcellent example. It was an outstanding demonstration ofteam work. I have always seen a project leader as anintegrator of people and that is precisely what Kalam is.” Iconsider Prof. Sarabhai as the Mahatma Gandhi of Indian'),\n",

Therenowned metallurgist, Dr Brahm Prakash, took over as thefirst Director of VSSC.The RATO system was successfully tested on 8October 1972 at Bareilly Air Force station in Uttar Pradesh,when a high performance Sukhoi-16 jet aircraft becameairborne after a short run of 1200 m, as against its usual runof 2 km. We used the 66th RATO motor in the test. Thedemonstration was watched by Air Marshal Shivdev Singhand Dr BD Nag Chaudhury, then the Scientific Adviser tothe Defence Minister. This effort was said to have savedapproximately Rs 4 crores in foreign exchange. The visionof the industrialist scientist had finally borne fruit.Before taking up the responsibility of organizing spaceresearch in India and becoming the chairman ofINCOSPAR, Prof. Sarabhai had established a number ofsuccessful industrial enterprises. He was aware thatscientific research could not survive in isolation, away fromindustry. Prof. Sarabhai founded Sarabhai Chemicals,Sarabhai Glass, Sarabhai Geigy Limited, Sarabhai MerckLimited, and the Sarabhai Engineering Group. His SwastikOil Mills did pioneering work in the extraction of oil fromoilseeds, manufacture of synthetic detergents and ofcosmetics. He geared Standard Pharmaceuticals Limitedto enable large-scale manufacture of penicillin, which wasimported from abroad at astronomical costs at that time.Now with the indigenization of RATO, his mission hadacquired a new dimension—independence in themanufacture of military hardware and the potential saving ofcrores of rupees in foreign exchange. I recalled this on theday of the successful trial of the RATO system. Includingtrial expenses, we spent less than Rs. 25 lakhs on theentire project. The Indian RATO could be produced atRs.17,000 apiece, and it replaced the imported RATO,which cost Rs. 33,000.At the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, work on theSLV went on at full swing. All the subsystems had beendesigned, technologies identified, processes established,work centres selected, manpower earmarked andschedules drawn. The only hitch was the lack of amanagement structure to effectively handle this mega-project and coordinate activities which were spread over alarge number of work centres with their own ways ofworking and management.Prof. Dhawan, in consultation with Dr Brahm Prakash,picked me for this job. I was appointed the ProjectManager—SLV, and reported directly to the Director,VSSC. My first task was to work out a project managementplan. I wondered why I was selected for this task when therewere stalwarts like Gowarikar, Muthunayagam, and Kuruparound. With organizers like Easwardas, Aravamudan, andSC Gupta available, how would I do better? I articulated mydoubts to Dr Brahm Prakash. He told me not to focus onwhat I saw as other people’s strengths compared to myown, but instead, to attempt to expand their abilities.'),\n",

TheSLV mission will be accomplished with, and through, alarge number of people. You will require a tremendousamount of tolerance and patience,” he said. It reminded meof what my father used to read to me from the Holy Qur’anon the distinction between right and wrong: “We have sentno apostle before you who did not eat or walk about themarket squares. We test you by means of one another. Willyou not have patience?”I was aware of the contradiction that often occurred insuch situations. People heading teams often have one ofthe following two orientations: for some, work is the mostimportant motivation; for others, their workers are the all-consuming interest. There are many others who fall eitherbetween these two positions or outside them. My job wasgoing to be to avoid those who were interested neither inthe work nor in the workers. I was determined to preventpeople from taking either extreme, and to promoteconditions where work and workers went together. Ivisualized my team as a group in which each memberworked to enrich the others in the team and experience theenjoyment of working together.The primary objectives of the SLV Project were design,development and operation of a standard SLV system,SLV-3, capable of reliably and expeditiously fulfilling thespecified mission of launching a 40 kg satellite into a 400km circular orbit around the earth.As a first step, I translated the primary project objectivesinto some major tasks. One such task was the developmentof a rocket motor system for the four stages of the vehicle.The critical problems in the completion of this task were:making an 8.6 tonne propellant grain and a high mass ratioapogee rocket motor system which would use highenergypropellants. Another task was vehicle control and guidance.Three types of control systems were involved in this task—aerodynamic surface control, thrust vector control andreaction control for the first, second and third stages andthe spin-up mechanism for the fourth stage. Inertialreference for control systems and guidance through inertialmeasurement was also imperative. Yet another major taskwas the augmentation of launch facilities at SHAR withsystems integration and checkout facilities anddevelopment of launch support systems such as launchersand vehicle assembly fixtures. A target of ‘all line’ flight testwithin 64 months was set in March 1973.I took up the executive responsibility of implementingthe project within the framework of policy decisions taken,the approved management plan, and the project report; andalso within the budget and through the powers delegated tome by the Director, VSSC. Dr Brahm Prakash formed fourProject Advisory Committees to advise me on specializedareas like rocket motors, materials and fabrication, controland guidance, electronics, and mission and launching. Iwas assured of the guidance of outstanding scientists likeDS Rane, Muthunayagam, TS Prahlad, AR Acharya, SCGupta, and CL Amba Rao, to name a few.The Holy Qur’an says: “We have sent down to yourevelations showing you an account of those who havegone before you and an admonition to righteous men.” Isought to share the wisdom of these extremely brilliantpeople. “Light upon light.

He has knowledge of all things.”We made three groups to carry out the project activities—a Programme Management Group, an Integration andFlight Testing Group and a Subsystems DevelopmentGroup. The first Group was made responsible for lookingafter the overall executive aspects of SLV-3: projectmanagement, including administration, planning andevaluation, subsystems specifications, materials,fabrication, quality assurance and control. The Integrationand Flight Testing Group was assigned the tasks ofgeneration of facilities required for integration and flighttesting of SLV-3. They were also asked to carry out theanalysis of the vehicle, including mechanical andaerodynamic interface problems. The SubsystemsDevelopment Group was given the job of interacting withvarious divisions of VSSC and was made responsible forensuring that all technological problems in the developmentof various subsystems were overcome by creating asynergy amongst the available talent in these divisions.I projected a requirement of 275 engineers andscientists for SLV-3 but could get only about 50. If it had notbeen for synergistic efforts, the whole project would haveremained a non-starter. Some young engineers like MSRDev, G Madhavan Nair, S Srinivasan, US Singh,Sunderrajan, Abdul Majeed, Ved Prakash Sandlas,Namboodiri, Sasi Kumar, and Sivathanu Pillai developedtheir own ground rules designed to help them workefficiently as a project team, and produced outstandingindividual and team results. These men were in the habit ofcelebrating their successes together—in a sort of mutualappreciation club. This boosted morale, and helped them agreat deal to accept setbacks and to revitalize themselvesafter periods of intense work.Each member of the SLV-3 project team was aspecialist in his own field. It was natural therefore that eachone of them valued his independence. To manage theperformance of such specialists the team leader has toadopt a delicate balance between the hands-on and thehands-off approach. The hands-on approach takes anactive interest on a very regular basis in the members’work. The hands-off approach trusts team members andrecognizes their need for autonomy to carry out their roles,as they see fit. It hinges on their self-motivation. When theleader goes too far with the hands-on approach, he is seenas an anxious and interfering type. If he goes too far hands-off, he is seen as abdicating his responsibility or not beinginterested. Today, the members of the SLV-3 team havegrown to lead some of the country’s most prestigiousprogrammes. MSR Dev heads the Augmented SatelliteLaunch Vehicle (ASLV) project, Madhavan Nair is the chiefof the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) project andSandlas and Sivathanu Pillai are Chief Controllers inDRDO Headquarters.

I used to prepare a general scheduleduring my morning walk, and emphasize two or three thingsI would definitely like to accomplish during the day,including at least one thing that would help achieve long-term goals.Once in the office, I would clean the table first. Within thenext ten minutes, I would scan all the papers and quicklydivide them into different categories: those that requiredimmediate action, low priority ones, ones that could be keptpending, and reading material. Then I would put the highpriority papers in front of me and everything else out ofsight.Coming back to SLV-3, about 250 sub-assemblies and44 major subsystems were conceived during the design.The list of materials went up to over 1 million components.A project implementation strategy had become essential toachieve sustained viability of this complex programme ofseven to ten years’ duration. From his side, Prof. Dhawancame up with a clear statement that all the manpower andfunds at VSSC and SHAR would have to be directed to us.From our side, we evolved a matrix type of management toachieve productive interfacing with more than 300industries.

Three things Istressed before my colleagues—importance of designcapability, goal setting and realisation, and the strength towithstand setbacks.

The musculature comes frompropellants. How are they made? What are the materialsand techniques involved?A large variety of materials go into the making of alaunch vehicle— both metallic and non-metallic, whichinclude composites and ceramics. In metals, different typesof stainless steel, alloys of aluminium, magnesium, titanium,copper, beryllium, tungsten and molybdenum are used.Composite materials are composed of a mixture orcombination of two or more constituents which differ in formand material composition and which are essentiallyinsoluble in one another. The materials which combine maybe metallic, organic or inorganic. While other materialcombinations possible are virtually unlimited, the mosttypical composites in launch vehicles are made of structuralconstituents, embedded in a matrix. We used a largevariety of glass fibre reinforced plastic composites andopened avenues for the entry of Kevlar, polyamides andcarbon-carbon composites. Ceramics are special types ofbaked clay used for microwave transparent enclosures. Weconsidered using ceramics, but had to reject the idea thendue to technological limitations.'),\n",

In fact, of all the engineeringdisciplines which feed directly into the development ofrocketry, mechanical engineering is perhaps the mostintrinsic one. Be it a sophisticated system like a liquidengine or a piece of hardware as simple as a fastener, itsultimate fabrication calls for expert mechanical engineersand precision machine tools. We decided to developimportant technologies like welding techniques for low-alloystainless steel, electroforming techniques, and ultra-precision process tooling. We also decided to make someimportant machines in-house, like the 254-litre verticalmixer and the groove machining facility for our third andfourth stages. Many of our subsystems were so massiveand complex that they implied sizeable financial outlays.Without any hesitation, we approached industries in theprivate sector and developed contract management planswhich later became blueprints for many government-runscience and technology business organizations.Coming to the life part of the SLV, there is the complexelectrical circuitry, which sets the mechanical structure inmotion. This vast spectrum of activities, encompassingsimple electrical power supplies to sophisticatedinstrumentation as well as guidance and control systems iscollectively referred to in aerospace research as ‘Avionics’.Development efforts in avionic systems had already beeninitiated at VSSC in the field of digital electronics,microwave radars and radar transponders, and inertialcomponents and systems. It is very important to know thestate of the SLV when it is in flight. SLV brought a newsurge of activity in the development of a variety oftransducers for measurement of physical parameters likepressure, thrust, vibration, acceleration, etc. Thetransducers convert the physical parameters of the vehicleinto electrical signals. An on-board telemetry systemprocesses these signals suitably and transmits them in theform of radio signals to the ground stations, where they arereceived and deciphered back to the original informationcollected by the transducers. If the systems work accordingto design there is little cause for concern; but in casesomething goes wrong, the vehicle must be destroyed tostop it from making any unexpected moves. To ensuresafety, a special tele-command system was made todestroy the rocket in case it malfunctions, and aninterferrometer system was developed to determine therange and position of the SLV, as a added means to theradar system. The SLV project also initiated the indigenousproduction of sequencers which time the various events,such as ignition, stage separation, vehicle altitudeprogrammers which store the information for the rocketmanoeuvres, and auto-pilot electronics which takeappropriate decisions to steer the rocket along itspredetermined path.Without the energy to propel the whole system, a launchvehicle remains grounded. A propellant is usually acombustible substance that produces heat and suppliesejection particles in a rocket engine. It is both a source ofenergy and a working substance for expanding energy.Because the distinction is more decisive in rocket engines,the term propellant is used primarily to describe chemicalscarried by rockets for propulsive purposes.It is customary to classify propellants as either solids orliquids. We concentrated on solid propellants. A solidpropellant consists essentially of three components: theoxidizer, the fuel and the additives. Solid propellants arefurther classified into two types: composite and double'),\n",

The former consists of an oxidizer or inorganicmaterial (like ammonium perchlorate) in a matrix of organicfuel (like synthetic rubber). Double base propellants weredistant dreams those days but nevertheless we dared todream about them.All this self sufficiency and indigenous manufacturecame gradually, and not always without pain. We were ateam of almost self-trained engineers. In retrospect I feelthe unique blend of our untutored talent, character, anddedication suited SLV development the most. Problemssurfaced regularly and almost consistently. But my teammembers never exhausted my patience. I recall writing afterwinding up a late night shift:Beautiful hands are those that doWork that is earnest and brave and trueMoment by momentThe long day through.Almost parallel to our work on SLV, the DRDO waspreparing itself for developing an indigenous surface-to-airmissile. The RATO project was abandoned because theaircraft for which it was designed became obsolete. Thenew aircraft did not need RATO. With the project called off,Narayanan was DRDO’s logical choice to lead the team formaking the missile. Unlike us at ISRO, they preferred thephilosophy of one-toone substitution rather than technologydevelopment and performance upgrading. The Surface-to-Air Missile SA–2 of Russian origin was chosen to acquiredetailed knowledge of all the design parameters of aproven missile and to establish, thereby, the necessaryinfrastructure required in the organization. It was thoughtthat once one-to-one indigenization was established,further advances in the sophisticated field of guidedmissiles would be a natural fall-out. The project wassanctioned in February 1972 with the code name Devil andfunding of about Rs. 5 crore was made available for the firstthree years. Almost half of it was to go in foreign exchange.By now promoted to Air Commodore, Narayanan tookover as Director, DRDL. He mobilized this young laboratorylocated in the southeastern suburbs of Hyderabad to takeup this enormous task. The landscape dotted with tombsand old buildings started reverberating with new life.Narayanan was a man of tremendous energy—a manalways in the boost phase. He gathered around him astrong group of enthusiastic people, drawing many serviceofficers into this predominantly civilian laboratory. Totallypreoccupied with the SLV affairs, my participation in theMissile Panel meetings gradually dwindled, and thenstopped altogether. However, stories about Narayanan andhis Devil were beginning to reach Trivandrum. Atransformation of an unprecedented scale was taking placethere.During my association with Narayanan in the RATOproject, I had discovered that he was a hard taskmaster—one who went all out for control, mastery and domination. Iused to wonder if managers like him, who aim at gettingresults no matter what the price, would face a rebellion ofsilence and non-cooperation in the long run.New Year’s day, 1975, brought with it an opportunity tohave a firstperson assessment of the work going on underNarayanan’s leadership. Prof. MGK Menon, who wasworking then as Scientific Advisor to the Defence Ministerand was head of the DRDO, appointed a review committeeunder the chairmanship of Dr Brahm Prakash to evaluatethe work carried out in the Devil Project. I was taken into theteam as a rocket specialist to evaluate the progress made'),\n",

On the propulsion aspects, I was assisted byBR Somasekhar and by Wg Cdr P Kamaraju. Thecommittee members included Dr RP Shenoy and Prof. IGSarma who were to review the work done on the electronicsystems.We met at DRDL on 1 and 2 January 1975, followed bya second session after about six weeks. We visited thevarious development work centres and held discussionswith the scientists there. I was greatly impressed by thevision of AV Ranga Rao, the dynamism of Wg Cdr RGopalaswami, the thoroughness of Dr I Achyuta Rao, theenterprise of G Ganesan, S Krishnan’s clarity of thoughtand R Balakrishnan’s critical eye for detail. The calm of JCBhattacharya and Lt Col R Swaminathan in the face ofimmense complexities was striking. The zeal andapplication of Lt Col VJ Sundaram was conspicuous. Theywere a brilliant, committed group of people—a mix ofservice officers and civilian scientists—who had trainedthemselves in the areas of their own interest out of theirdriving urge to fly an Indian missile.We had our concluding meeting towards the end ofMarch 1975 at Trivandrum. We felt that the progress in theexecution of the project was adequate in respect ofhardware fabrication to carry out the philosophy of one-to-one substitution of missile subsystems except in the liquidrocket area, where some more time was required tosucceed. The committee was of the unanimous opinion thatDRDL had achieved the twin goals of hardware fabricationand system analysis creditably in the design anddevelopment of the ground electronics complex assignedto them.We observed that the one-to-one substitutionphilosophy had taken precedence over the generation ofdesign data. Consequently, many design engineers had notbeen able to pay adequate attention to the necessaryanalysis which was the practice followed by us at VSSC.The system analysis studies carried out up to then had alsobeen only of a preliminary nature. In all, the resultsaccomplished were outstanding, but we still had a long wayto go. I recalled a school poem:Don’t worry and fret, fainthearted,The chances have just begun,For the best jobs haven’t been started,The best work hasn’t been done.The committee made a strong recommendation to theGovernment to give Devil a further go-ahead. Ourrecommendation was accepted and the project proceeded.Back home at VSSC, SLV was taking shape. Incontrast to the DRDL which was sprinting ahead, we weremoving slowly. Instead of following the leader, my team wastrekking towards success on several individual paths. Theessence of our method of work was an emphasis oncommunication, particularly in the lateral direction, amongthe teams and within the teams. In a way, communicationwas my mantra for managing this gigantic project. To getthe best from my team members, I spoke to them frequentlyon the goals and objectives of the organization,emphasizing the importance of each member’s specificcontribution towards the realisation of these goals. At thesame time, I tried to be receptive to every constructive ideaemanating from my subordinates and to relay it in anappropriate form for critical examination andimplementation.

In fact, the two are distinctly different. I was(and am) a terrible conversationalist but consider myself agood communicator. A conversation full of pleasantries ismost often devoid of any useful information, whereascommunication is meant only for the exchange ofinformation. It is very important to realise thatcommunication is a twoparty affair which aims at passingon or receiving a specific piece of information.While working on the SLV, I used communication topromote understanding and to come to an agreement withcolleagues in defining the problems that existed and inidentifying the action necessary to be taken to solve them.Authentic communication was one of the tools skilfully usedin managing the project. How did I do that ? To begin with, Itried to be factual and never sugar-coated the bitter pill offacts. At one of the Space Science Council (SSC) reviewmeetings, frustrated by the procurement delays, I eruptedinto an agitated complaint against the indifference and red-tape tactics of the controller of accounts and financialadvisor of VSSC. I insisted that the systems of workfollowed by the accounts staff had to change anddemanded the delegation of their functions to the projectteam. Dr Brahm Prakash was taken aback by the bluntnessof my submission. He stubbed out his cigarette and walkedout of the meeting.I spent the whole night regretting the pain my harshwords had caused Dr Brahm Prakash. However, I wasdetermined to fight the inertia built into the system before Ifound myself being dragged down with it. I asked myself apractical question: could one live with these insensitivebureaucrats? The answer was a big no. Then I askedmyself a private question: what would hurt Dr BrahmPrakash more, my seemingly harsh words now, or theburial of the SLV at a later stage? Finding my head andheart agreeing, I prayed to God for help. Fortunately for me,Dr Brahm Prakash delegated financial powers to theproject the next morning.Anyone who has taken up the responsibility to lead ateam can be successful only if he is sufficientlyindependent, powerful and influential in his own right tobecome a person to reckon with. This is perhaps also thepath to individual satisfaction in life, for freedom withresponsibility is the only sound basis for personalhappiness. What can one do to strengthen personalfreedom? I would like to share with you two techniques Iadopt in this regard.First, by building your own education and skills.Knowledge is a tangible asset, quite often the mostimportant tool in your work. The more up-to-date theknowledge you possess, the freer you are. Knowledgecannot be taken away from anyone except byobsolescence. A leader can only be free to lead his team ifhe keeps abreast of all that is happening around him—inreal time. To lead, in a way, is to engage in continuingeducation. In many countries, it is normal for professionalsto go to college several nights every week. To be asuccessful team leader, one has to stay back after the dinand clutter of a working day to emerge better-equipped andready to face a new day.The second way is to develop a passion for personalresponsibility.

Thehistorian Edith Hamilton wrote of ancient Greece, “Whenthe freedom they wished for most was freedom fromresponsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and wasnever free again”. The truth is that there is a great deal thatmost of us can individually do to increase our freedom. Wecan combat the forces that threaten to oppress us. We canfortify ourselves with the qualities and conditions thatpromote individual freedom. In doing so, we help to createa stronger organization, capable of achievingunprecedented goals.As work on the SLV gained momentum, Prof. Dhawanintroduced the system of reviewing progress with the entireteam involved in the project. Prof. Dhawan was a man witha mission. He would effortlessly pull together all the looseends to make work move smoothly. At VSSC the reviewmeetings presided over by Prof. Dhawan used to beconsidered major events. He was a true captain of theISRO ship—a commander, navigator, housekeeper, allrolled into one. Yet, he never pretended to know more thanhe did. Instead, when something appeared ambiguous, hewould ask questions and discuss his doubts frankly. Iremember him as a leader for whom to lead with a firm, butfair hand, was a moral compulsion. His mind used to bevery firm once it had been decided on any issue. But beforetaking a decision, it used to be like clay, open toimpressions until the final moulding. Then the decisionswould be popped into the potter’s oven for glazing, neverfailing to emerge hard and tough, resistant and enduring.I had the privilege of spending a great deal of time withProf. Dhawan. He could hold the listener enthralledbecause of the logical, intellectual acumen he could bring tobear on his analysis of any subject. He had an unusualcombination of degrees—a B.Sc. in Mathematics andPhysics, an M.A. in English Literature, B.E. in MechanicalEngineering, M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering followed bya Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Mathematics from theCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech) in USA.Intellectual debates with him were very stimulating andcould always mentally energize me and my team members.I found him full of optimism and compassion. Although heoften judged himself harshly, with no allowances orexcuses, he was generous to a fault when it came to others.Prof. Dhawan used to sternly pronounce his judgementsand then pardon the contrite guilty parties.In 1975, ISRO became a government body. An ISROcouncil was formed consisting of Directors of different workcentres and senior officers in the Department of Space(DoS). This provided a symbolic link as well as a forum forparticipative management between the DoS which had theGovernmental powers and the centres which would executethe jobs. In the traditional parlance of Governmentdepartments, ISRO’s centres would have been subordinateunits or attached offices, but such words were neverspoken either at ISRO or DoS. Participative management,which calls for active interaction between those who wieldadministrative powers and the executing agencies, was anovel feature of ISRO management that would go a longway in Indian R&D organizations.The new set-up brought me in contact with TN Seshan,the Joint Secretary in the DoS.

What was new was my awareness of it, myawakening to its fathomless dimensions. I used toerroneously suppose that the function of science was toexplain everything, and that unexplained phenomena werethe province of people like my father and LakshmanaSastry. However, I always refrained from discussing thesematters with any of my scientist colleagues, fearing that itwould threaten the hegemony of their meticulously formedviews.Gradually, I became aware of the difference betweenscience and technology, between research anddevelopment. Science is inherently open-ended andexploratory. Development is a closed loop. Mistakes areimperative in development and are made every day, buteach mistake is used for modification, upgradation orbetterment. Probably, the Creator created engineers tomake scientists achieve more. For each time scientistscome up with a thoroughly researched and fullycomprehended solution, engineers show them yet anotherlumineu, yet one more possibility. I cautioned my teamagainst becoming scientists. Science is a passion—anever-ending voyage into promises and possibilities. Wehad only limited time and limited funds. Our making theSLV depended upon our awareness of our own limits. Ipreferred existing workable solutions which would be thebest options.

Asparticipants in the SLV-3 project, we set three milestonesfor ourselves: development and flight qualification of allsubsystems through sounding rockets by 1975; sub-orbitalflights by 1976; and the final orbital flight in 1978. The worktempo had picked up now and the atmosphere wascharged with excitement. Wherever I went, our teams hadsomething interesting to show me. A large number of thingswere being done for the first time in the country and thegroundlevel technicians had had no prior exposure to thiskind of work. I saw new performance dimensions growingamong my team members.Performance dimensions are factors that lead tocreation. They go beyond competencies such as the skillsand knowledge of the individual. Performance dimensionsare broader and deeper than what a person must know andbe able to do in order to function well in his or her job. Theyinclude attitudes, values and character traits. They exist atvarious levels of the human personality. At the behaviourallevel—at the outermost ring of the tree—we can observeskills and measure knowledge. Social roles and self-imagedimensions are found at the intermediate level. Motivesand traits exist at the innermost or core level. If we canidentify those performance dimensions which are mosthighly correlated with job success, we can put themtogether to form a blueprint for outstanding performance inboth thought and action.Although SLV-3 was still in the future, its subsystemswere being completed. In June 1974, we used the Centaursounding rocket launch to test some of our critical systems.A scaled down heat shield of SLV, Rate Gyro Unit, andVehicle Attitude Programmer were integrated into theCentaur rocket. The three systems involved wide-rangingexpertise— composite materials, control engineering andsoftware, none of them ever having been tried before in thecountry. The test was a complete success. Until then theIndian Space Programme had not gone beyond soundingrockets and even knowledgeable people were not ready tosee and acknowledge its efforts as anything more seriousthan fiddling around with meteorological instruments. Forthe first time, we inspired the confidence of the nation.Prime Minister Indira Gandhi told Parliament on 24 July1974, “The development and fabrication of relevanttechnologies, subsystems and hardware (to make India’sfirst Satellite Launch Vehicle) are progressing satisfactorily.A number of industries are engaged in the fabrication ofcomponents. The first orbital flight by India is scheduled totake place in 1978.”Like any other act of creation, the creation of the SLV-3also had its painful moments. One day, when my team and Iwere totally engrossed in the preparation of the static testof the first stage motor, the news of a death in the familyreached me. My brother-in-law and mentor Jenab AhmedJallaludin, was no more. For a couple of minutes, I wasimmobilized, I could not think, could not feel anything. WhenI could focus on my surroundings once more and attemptedto participate in the work, I found myself talking incoherently—and then I realised that, with Jallaluddin, a part of me hadpassed away too.

I felt the whole of my inner self drowning in asort of anxious agitation, and inner conflicts between mypersonal and my professional life.

He had lost his desire to live, as though after seeingJallaluddin return to his divine source, he too had becomeeager to return to his.Whenever I learnt about my father’s indifferent health, Iwould visit Rameswaram with a good city doctor. Everytime I did so, he would chide me for my unnecessaryconcern and lecture me on the expenses incurred on thedoctor. “Your visit is enough for me to get well, why bring adoctor and spend money on his fees?” he would ask. Thistime he had gone beyond the capabilities of any doctor,care or money. My father Jainulabdeen, who had lived onRameswaram island for 102 years, had passed awayleaving behind fifteen grandchildren and onegreatgrandson. He had led an exemplary life.

Was I too stubborn or was I excessivelypreoccupied with the SLV? Should I not have forgotten for awhile my own affairs in order to listen to her? I regretfullyrealised this only when she passed away soon afterwards.The SLV-3 Apogee rocket, developed as a commonupper stage with Diamont, scheduled to be flight tested inFrance was mired in a series of knotty problems. I had torush to France to sort them out. Before I could depart, latein the afternoon, I was informed that my mother had passedaway. I took the first available bus to Nagarcoil. From there,I travelled to Rameswaram spending a whole night in thetrain and performed the last rites the next morning. Both thepeople who had formed me had left for their heavenlyabode. The departed had reached the end of their journey.The rest of us had to continue walking the weary road andlife had to go on. I prayed in the mosque my father hadonce taken me to every evening. I told Him that my mothercould not have lived longer in the world without the care andlove of her husband, and therefore had preferred to joinhim. I begged His forgiveness. “They carried out the task Idesigned for them with great care, dedication and honestyand came back to me. Why are you mourning their day ofaccomplishment? Concentrate on the assignments that liebefore you, and proclaim my glory through your deeds!”Nobody had said these words, but I heard them loud andclear. An inspiring aphorism in the Qur’an on the passingaway of souls filled my mind: “Your wealth and children areonly a temptation whereas: Allah! with Him is an eternalaward.” I came out of the mosque with my mind at peaceand proceeded to the railway station. I always rememberthat when the call for namaz sounded, our home wouldtransform into a small mosque. My father and my motherleading, and their children and grandchildren following.The next morning I was back at Thumba, physicallyexhausted, emotionally shattered, but determined to fulfillour ambition of flying an Indian rocket motor on foreign soil.On my return from France, after successfully testing theSLV-3 apogee motor, Dr Brahm Prakash informed me oneday about the arrival of Wernher von Braun. Everybodyworking in rocketry knows of von Braun, who made thelethal V-2 missiles that devastated London in the SecondWorld War. In the final stages of the War, von Braun wascaptured by the Allied Forces. As a tribute to his genius,von Braun was given a top position in the rocketryprogramme at NASA. Working for the US Army, von Braunproduced the landmark Jupiter missile, which was the firstIRBM with a 3000 km range. When I was asked by DrBrahm Prakash to receive von Braun at Madras and escorthim to Thumba, I was naturally excited.The V-2 missile (an abbreviation of the German wordVergeltungswaffe) was by far the greatest singleachievement in the history of rockets and missiles. It wasthe culmination of the efforts made by von Braun and histeam in the VFR (Society for Space Flight) in the 1920s.What had begun as a civilian effort soon became an officialarmy one, and von Braun became the technical director ofthe German Missile Laboratory at Kummersdorf. The firstV-2 missile was first tested unsuccessfully in June 1942. Ittoppled over on to its side and exploded. But on 16 August1942, it became the first missile to exceed the speed ofsound. Under the supervision of von Braun, more than10,000 V-2 missiles were produced between April andOctober 1944 at the gigantic underground production unitnear Nordhausen in Germany.

I never expected the father of modernrocketry to be so humble, receptive and encouraging. Hemade me feel comfortable right through the flight. It washard to imagine that I was talking to a giant of missilesystems, as he was so self-effacing.He observed that the length to diameter L/D ratio of theSLV3, which was designed to be 22 was on the higher sideand cautioned me about the aero-elastic problems whichmust be avoided during flight.Having spent the major part of his working life inGermany, how did he feel in America? I asked this of vonBraun who had become a cult figure in the States aftercreating the Saturn rocket in the Apollo mission which putman on the moon. “America is a country of greatpossibilities, but they look upon everything un-Americanwith suspicion and contempt. They suffer from a deep-rooted NIH—Not Invented Here—complex and look downon alien technologies. If you want to do anything in rocketry,do it yourself,” von Braun advised me. He commented,“SLV-3 is a genuine Indian design and you may be havingyour own troubles. But you should always remember that wedon’t just build on successes, we also build on failures.”On the topic of the inevitable hard work that goes withrocket development and the degree of commitmentinvolved, he smiled and said with a glint of mischief in hiseyes, “Hard work is not enough in rocketry. It is not a sportwhere mere hard work can fetch you honours. Here, notonly do you have to have a goal but you have to havestrategies to achieve it as fast as possible.”“Total commitment is not just hard work, it is totalinvolvement. Building a rock wall is back-breaking work.There are some people who build rock walls all their lives.And when they die, there are miles of walls, mutetestimonials to how hard those people had worked.”He continued, “But there are other men who whileplacing one rock on top of another have a vision in theirminds, a goal. It may be a terrace with roses climbing overthe rock walls and chairs set out for lazy summer days. Orthe rock wall may enclose an apple orchard or mark aboundary. When they finish, they have more than a wall. It isthe goal that makes the difference. Do not make rocketryyour profession, your livelihood— make it your religion, yourmission.” Did I see something of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai invon Braun? It made me happy to think so.With three deaths in the family in as many successiveyears, I needed total commitment to my work in order tokeep performing. I wanted to throw all my being into thecreation of the SLV. I felt as if I had discovered the path Iwas meant to follow, God’s mission for me and my purposeon His earth. During this period, it was as though I hadpushed a hold button—no badminton in the evenings, nomore weekends or holidays, no family, no relations, noteven any friends outside the SLV circle.To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal. Individuals like myself areoften called ‘workaholics’. I question this term because thatimplies a pathological condition or an illness. If I do thatwhich I desire more than anything else in the world andwhich makes me happy, such work can never be anaberration.

Climbing to the top demandsstrength, whether to the top of Mount Everest or to the top ofyour career. People are born with different energy reservesand the one who tires first and burns out easily will do wellto reorganize his or her life at the earliest.In 1979, a six-member team was preparing the flightversion of a complex second stage control system for statictest and evaluation. The team was in countdown mode at T-15 minutes (15 minutes before the test). One of the twelvevalves did not respond during checkout. Anxiety drove themembers of the team to the test site to look into theproblem. Suddenly the oxidizer tank, filled with red fumingnitric acid (RFNA), burst, causing severe acid burns to theteam members. It was a very traumatic experience to seethe suffering of the injured. Kurup and I rushed to theTrivandrum Medical College Hospital and begged to haveour colleagues admitted, as six beds were not available inthe hospital at that point of time.Sivaramakrishnan Nair was one among the six personsinjured. The acid had burned his body at a number ofplaces. By the time we got a bed in the hospital, he was insevere pain. I kept vigil at his bedside. Around 3 o’ clock inthe morning, Sivarama-krishnan regained consciousness.His first words expressed regret over the mishap andassured me that he would make up the slippage inschedules caused by the accident. His sincerity andoptimism, even in the midst of such severe pain, impressedme deeply.Men like Sivaramakrishnan are a breed apart. They arethe strivers, always reaching higher than the last time. Andwith their social and family life welded to their dream, theyfind the rewards of their drive overwhelming—the inherentjoy of being in flow. This event greatly enhanced myconfidence in my team; a team that would stand like a rockin success and failure.I have used the word ‘flow’ at many places without reallyelaborating its meaning. What is this flow? And what arethese joys? I could call them moments of magic. I see ananalogy between these moments and the high that youexperience when you play badminton or go jogging. Flow isa sensation we experience when we act with totalinvolvement. During flow, action follows action according toan internal logic that seems to need no consciousintervention on the part of the worker. There is no hurry;there are no distracting demands on one’s attention. Thepast and the future disappear. So does the distinctionbetween self and the activity.

How did ithappen? Who had created this flow?Perhaps it was the meaningful organization of thepurposes we sought to achieve. We would identify thebroadest possible purpose level and then work towardsdeveloping a feasible target solution from a variety ofalternatives. It was this working backwards to develop acreative change in the problem solution, that used to put usin ‘flow’.When the SLV-3 hardware started emerging, our abilityto concentrate increased markedly. I felt a tremendoussurge of confidence; in complete control over myself andover the SLV-3 project. Flow is a by-product of controlledcreativity. The first requirement is to work as hard as youcan at something that presents a challenge and isapproved by your heart. It may not be an overwhelmingchallenge, but one that stretches you a little, something thatmakes you realise that you are performing a task bettertoday than you did yesterday, or the last time you tried to doit. Another prerequisite for being in flow is the availability ofa significant span of uninterrupted time. In my experience, itis difficult to switch into the flow state in less than half anhour. And it is almost impossible if you are bedevilled byinterruptions.Is it possible to switch yourself into flow by using somesort of a conditioning device in much the same way that wecondition ourselves to learn effectively? The answer is yes,and the secret is to analyse previous occasions when youhave been in flow, because each person has his or herunique natural frequency which responds to a particularstimulus. You alone can identify the common denominatorin your case. Once you have isolated this commondenominator, you can set the stage for flow.I have experienced this state many times, almost everyday of the SLV mission. There have been days in thelaboratory when I have looked up to find the laboratoryempty and realised that it was way past the quitting time.On other days, my team members and I have been socaught up in our work that the lunch hour slipped by withoutour even being conscious that we were hungry.Analysing such occasions in retrospect, I find themsimilar in the sense that this flow was experienced when theproject was nearing completion, or when the project hadreached that phase when all the necessary data had beengathered and we were ready to start summing up theproblem, outlining the demands made by conflicting criteriaand the various positions presented by opposing interestsand making our recommendations for action. I also realisedthat this tended to happen on days that were relatively quietin the office, with no crises or meetings. Such spellsincreased steadily in frequency, and the SLV-3 dream wasfinally realised in the middle of 1979.We had scheduled the first experimental flight trial ofSLV-3 for 10 August 1979. The primary goals of themission were to realise a fully integrated launch vehicle; toevaluate on-board systems like stage motors, guidanceand control systems and electronic subsystems; and toevaluate ground systems, like checkout, tracking, telemetryand real-time data facilities in launch operations built at theSriharikota launch complex. The 23 metre-long, four-stageSLV rocket weighing 17 tonnes finally took off elegantly at0758 hours and immediately started following itsprogrammed trajectory.Stage I performed to perfection.

The second stage went outof control. The flight was terminated after 317 seconds andthe vehicle’s remains, including my favourite fourth stagewith the payload splashed into the sea, 560 km offSriharikota.The incident caused us profound disappointment. I felt astrange mix of anger and frustration. Suddenly, I felt my legsbecome so stiff that they ached. The problem was not withmy body; something was happening in my mind.The premature death of my hovercraft Nandi, theabandoning of the RATO, the abortion of the SLV-Diamontfourth stage—all came alive in a flash, like a long-buriedPhoenix rising from its ashes. Over the years, I hadsomehow learned to absorb these aborted endeavours,had come to terms with them and pursued fresh dreams.That day, I re-lived each of those setbacks in my deepdespondency.“What do you suppose could be the cause of it?”somebody asked me in the Block House. I tried to find ananswer, but I was too tired to try and think it out, and gaveup the effort as futile. The launch was conducted in the earlymorning, preceded by a full night’s count-down. Moreover, Ihad hardly had any sleep in the past week. Completelydrained—mentally as well as physically—I went straight tomy room and slumped onto the bed.A gentle touch on my shoulder woke me up. It was latein the afternoon, almost approaching evening. I saw DrBrahm Prakash sitting by my bedside. “What about goingfor lunch?” he asked. I was deeply touched by his affectionand concern. I found out later that Dr Brahm Prakash hadcome to my room twice before that but had gone away onfinding me asleep. He had waited all that time for me to getup and have lunch with him. I was sad, but not alone. Thecompany of Dr Brahm Prakash filled me with a newconfidence.

In practice, Dr Brahm Prakash employed the front-line damage control principle: “Just get the fellow homealive. He’ll recover.” He drew the entire SLV team closeand demonstrated to me that I was not alone in my sorrowat the SLV-3’s failure. “All your comrades are standing byyou,” he said. This gave me vital emotional support,encouragement, and guidance.A post-flight review conducted on 11 August 1979 wasattended by more than seventy scientists. A detailedtechnical appraisal of the failure was completed. Later, thepost-flight analysis committee headed by SK Athithanpinpointed the reasons for the malfunction of the vehicle. Itwas established that the mishap occurred because of thefailure of the second stage control system. No control forcewas available during the second stage flight due to whichthe vehicle became aerodynamically unstable, resulting inaltitude and velocity loss. This caused the vehicle to fall intothe sea even before the other stages could ignite.Further in-depth analysis of the second-stage failureidentified the reason as the draining of a good amount ofRed Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA) used as the oxidizer for thefuel power at that stage. Consequently, when the controlforce was demanded, only fuel was injected resulting inzero force. ‘A solenoid valve in the oxidizer tank remainingopen due to contamination after the first command at T-8minutes’, was identified as the reason for the draining ofRFNA.The findings were presented to Prof. Dhawan at ameeting of top ISRO scientists and were accepted.Everybody was convinced by the technical cause-and-effect sequence presented and there was a general feelingof satisfaction about the whole exercise of failure-management measures taken. I was still unconvincedthough and felt restless. To me, the level of responsibility ismeasured by one’s ability to confront the decision-makingprocess without any delay or distraction.On the spur of the moment, I stood up and addressedProf. Dhawan, “Sir, even though my friends have technicallyjustified the failure, I take the responsibility for judging theRFNA leak detected during the final phase of countdown asinsignificant. As a Mission Director, I should have put thelaunch on hold and saved the flight if possible. In a similarsituation abroad, the Mission Director would have lost hisjob. I therefore take responsibility for the SLV-3 failure.” Forquite some time there was pin-drop silence in the hall. ThenProf. Dhawan got up and said, “I am going to put Kalam inorbit!”, and left the place signalling that the meeting wasover.The pursuit of science is a combination of great elationand great despair. I went over many such episodes in mymind. Johannes Kepler, whose three orbital laws form thebasis of space research, took nearly 17 years afterformulating the two laws about planetary motion around thesun, to enunciate his third law which gives the relationbetween the size of the elliptical orbit and the length of timeit takes for the planet to go around the sun. How manyfailures and frustrations must he have gone through? Theidea that man could land on the moon, developed by theRussian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, wasrealised after nearly four decades—and by the UnitedStates, at that. Prof. Chandrasekhar had to wait nearly 50years before receiving the Nobel Prize for his discovery of'),\n",

If his workhad been recognized then, it could have led to thediscovery of the Black Hole decades earlier. How manyfailures must von Braun have gone through before hisSaturn launch vehicle put man on the moon? Thesethoughts helped to give me the ability to withstandapparently irreversible setbacks.Early in November 1979, Dr Brahm Prakash retired. Hehad always been my sheet-anchor in the turbulent waters ofVSSC. His belief in team spirit had inspired themanagement pattern for the SLV project, which laterbecame a blueprint for all scientific projects in the country.Dr Brahm Prakash was a very wise counsellor who gaveme valuable guidance whenever I deviated from mymission objectives.Dr Brahm Prakash not only reinforced the traits which Ihad acquired from Prof. Sarabhai, but also helped me givethem new dimensions. He always cautioned me againsthaste. “Big scientific projects are like mountains, whichshould be climbed with as little effort as possible andwithout urgency. The reality of your own nature shoulddetermine your speed. If you become restless, speed up. Ifyou become tense and highstrung, slow down. You shouldclimb the mountain in a state of equilibrium. When eachtask of your project is not just a means to an end but aunique event in itself, then you are doing it well,” he wouldtell me. The echo of Dr Brahm Prakash’s advice could beheard in Emerson’s poem on Brahma:If the red slayer think he slays,Or, if the slain think he is slain,They know not well, the subtle waysI keep, and pass, and turn again.To live only for some unknown future is superficial. It islike climbing a mountain to reach the peak withoutexperiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustainlife, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience isgained, and technologies are mastered. The importance ofthe peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So Iwent on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides.I had a long way to go but I was in no hurry. I went in littlesteps—just one step after another—but each step towardsthe top.At every stage, the SLV-3 team was blessed with someextraordinarily courageous people. Along with Sudhakarand Sivaramakrishnan, there was also Sivakaminathan. Hewas entrusted with bringing the C-Band transponder fromTrivandrum to SHAR for integration with the SLV-3. Thetransponder is a device fitted with the rocket system to givethe radar signals which are powerful enough to help it trackthe vehicle from the take-off site to the final impact point.The SLV-3 launch schedule was dependent on the arrivaland integration of this equipment. On landing at the Madrasairport, the aircraft which Sivakami was travelling inskidded and overshot the runway. Dense smoke engulfedthe aircraft. Everyone jumped out of the aircraft throughemergency exits, and desperately fought to savethemselves—all except Sivakami, who stayed in the aircrafttill he removed the transponder from his baggage. He wasamong the last few persons, the others being mostly aircraftcrew, to emerge from the smoke and he was hugging thetransponder close to his chest.Another incident from those days that I recall clearlyrelates to Prof. Dhawan’s visit to the SLV-3 assemblybuilding.

This would preventthe freak possibility of water gushing out and damaging therocket. To our surprise, within minutes of Madhavan Nairgetting the ports reversed, powerful water jets gushed outof the ports. The Vehicle Safety Officer had ensured thefunctioning of the fire-fighting system without realising that itcould have wrecked the entire rocket. This was a lesson inforesight. Or did we have divine protection?On 17 July 1980, 30 hours before the launch of thesecond SLV-3, the newspapers were filled with all kinds ofpredictions. One of the newspapers reported, “The ProjectDirector is missing and could not be contacted.” Manyreports preferred to trace the history of the first SLV3 flight,and recalled how the third stage had failed to ignitebecause of lack of fuel and the rocket had nosedived intothe ocean. Some highlighted SLV-3’s possible militaryimplications in terms of acquiring the capability for buildingIRBMs. Some were a general prognosis of all that ailed ourcountry and related it to the SLV-3. I knew that the nextday’s launch was going to decide the future of the Indianspace programme. In fact, to put it simply, the eyes of thewhole nation were on us.In the early hours of the next day, 18 July 1980—at 0803hrs to be precise, India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle,SLV-3 lifted off from SHAR. At 600 seconds before take-off, I saw the computer displaying data about stage IVgiving the required velocity to the Rohini Satellite (carriedas payload) to enter its orbit. Within the next two minutes,Rohini was set into motion in a low earth orbit. I spoke, inthe midst of screeching decibels, the most important wordsI had ever uttered in my life, “Mission Director calling allstations. Stand by for an important announcement. Allstages performed to mission requirements. The fourthstage apogee motor has given the required velocity to putRohini Satellite into orbit”. There were happy crieseverywhere. When I came out of the Block House, I waslifted onto the shoulders of my jubilant colleagues andcarried in a procession.The whole nation was excited. India had made its entryinto the small group of nations which possessed satellitelaunch capability. Newspapers carried news of the event intheir headlines. Radio and television stations aired specialprogrammes. Parliament greeted the achievement with thethumping of desks. It was both the culmination of a nationaldream, and the beginning of a very important phase in ournation’s history. Prof. Satish Dhawan, Chairman ISRO,threw his customary guardedness to the winds andannounced that it was now well within our ability to explorespace. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi cabled hercongratulations. But the most important reaction was that ofthe Indian scientific community—everybody was proud ofthis hundred per cent indigenous effort.I experienced mixed feelings. I was happy to achievethe success which had been evading me for the past twodecades, but I was sad because the people who hadinspired me were no longer there to share my joy—myfather, my brother-in-law Jallaluddin, and Prof. Sarabhai.The credit for the successful SLV-3 flight goes, first, to'),\n",

Gradually, the dinand clatter of the celebrations calmed down. I retired to mybed with almost no energy left. Through the open window, Icould see the moon among the clouds. The sea breezeseemed to reflect the buoyancy of the mood on Sriharikotaisland that day.Within a month of the SLV-3 success, I visited the NehruScience Centre in Bombay for a day, in response to aninvitation to share my experiences with the SLV-3. There, Ireceived a telephone call from Prof. Dhawan in Delhi,asking me to join him the next morning. We were to meetthe Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi. My hosts at theNehru Centre were kind enough to arrange my ticket toDelhi, but I had a small problem. It had to do with myclothes. I was dressed casually as is my wont and wearingslippers—not, by any standards of etiquette, suitable attirein which to meet the Prime Minister! When I told Prof.Dhawan about this problem, he told me not to worry aboutmy dress. “You are beautifully clothed in your success,” hequipped.Prof. Dhawan and I arrived at the Parliament HouseAnnexe the next morning. A meeting of the ParliamentaryPanel on Science & Technology chaired by the PrimeMinister was scheduled.

Ionly know how to build a rocket system in our country, whichwould inject a satellite, built in our country, by imparting to ita velocity of 25,000 km per hour.” There was thunderousapplause. I thanked the members for giving us anopportunity to work on a project like the SLV-3 and provethe scientific strength of our country. The entire room wasirradiated with happiness.Now that Project SLV-3 had been successfullycompleted, VSSC had to re-organize its resources andredefine its goals. I wanted to be relieved of the projectactivities, and consequently Ved Prakash Sandlas from myteam was made the Project Director for the SLV-3Continuation Project, which aimed at making operationalsatellite launch vehicles of a similar class. With a view toupgrade the SLV-3 by means of certain technologicalinnovations, the development of Augmented SatelliteLaunch Vehicles (ASLVs) had been on the cards for sometime. The aim was to enhance the SLV-3 payloadcapability from 40 kg to 150 kg. MSR Dev from my teamwas appointed Project Director ASLV. Then, to reach thesun-synchronous orbit (900 km), a PSLV was to be made.The Geo Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was also'),\n",

I took up theposition of Director, Aerospace Dynamics and DesignGroup, so that I could configure the forthcoming launchvehicles and technology development.The existing VSSC infrastructure was inadequate tohandle the size and weight of the future launch vehiclesystems and the implementation of all these projects wasgoing to require highly specialized facilities. New siteswere identified for the expanded activities of VSSC, atVattiyoorkavu and Valiamala. Dr Srinivasan drew up adetailed plan of the facilities. Meanwhile, I carried out ananalysis of the application of SLV-3 and its variants withSivathanu Pillai, and compared the existing launch vehiclesof the world for missile applications. We established thatthe SLV-3 solid rocket systems would meet the nationalrequirements of payload delivery vehicles for short andintermediate ranges (4000 km). We contended that thedevelopment of one additional solid booster of 1.8 mdiameter with 36 tonnes of propellant along with SLV-3subsystems would meet the ICBM requirement (above5000 km for a 1000 kg payload). This proposal was,however, never considered. It nevertheless paved the wayfor the formulation of the Re-entry Experiment (REX) which,much later on, became Agni.The next SLV-3 flight, SLV3-D1, took off on 31 May1981. I witnessed this flight from the visitors’ gallery. Thiswas the first time I witnessed a launch from outside theControl Centre. The unpalatable truth I had to face was thatby becoming the focus of media attention, I had arousedenvy among some of my senior colleagues, all of whom hadequally contributed to the success of SLV-3. Was I hurt atthe coldness of the new environment? Perhaps yes, but Iwas willing to accept what I couldn’t change.I have never lived off the profits of others’ minds. My life,in keeping with my nature, has never been that of a ruthlessachiever. The SLV-3 was made not by force andmanipulation, but through consistent collective effort. Thenwhy this sense of bitterness? Was it peculiar to the VSSCtop level or a universal reality? As a scientist, I was trainedto reason out reality. In science, reality is that which exists.And because this bitterness was real, I had to reason it out.But can these things be reasoned out?Were my post-SLV experiences leading me into acritical situation? Yes and no. Yes, because the glory ofSLV-3 had not gone to everyone who deserved it—buthardly anything could have been done about that. No,because a situation can be considered critical for a persononly when realisation of the internal necessity becomesimpossible. And that certainly was not the case. In fact, theconcept of conflict is built upon this basic idea. Inretrospect, I can only say that I was fully aware of a greatneed for actualization and renewal.In January 1981, I was invited by Dr Bhagiratha Rao ofthe High Altitude Laboratory (now the Defence ElectronicsApplications Laboratory (DEAL)), Dehra Dun to give alecture on the SLV-3. The renowned nuclear scientist, Prof.Raja Ramanna, whom I had always admired, and who wasthen the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister,presided over the gathering. He spoke on India’s efforts ingenerating nuclear energy and the challenge in conductingthe first nuclear test for peaceful purposes. As I had beenso closely involved with SLV-3, it was natural that I wassoon in full spate about it. Later, Prof. Raja Ramannainvited me for a private meeting over tea.The first thing that struck me when I met Prof. Ramannawas his genuine pleasure at meeting me. There was an'),\n",

The world ofProf. Sarabhai was internally simple and externally easy.Each of us working with him was driven by a single-mindedneed to create, and lived under conditions which made theobject of that need directly accessible. Sarabhai’s worldwas tailor-made to our dreams. It had neither too much nortoo little of anything needed by any one of us. We coulddivide it by our requirements without a remainder.My world, by now, had no simplicity left in it. It hadbecome an internally complex and externally difficult world.My efforts in rocketry and in achieving the goal of makingindigenous rockets were impeded by external obstaclesand complicated by internal wavering. I was aware that itrequired a special effort of the will to sustain my trajectory.The coordination of my present with my past had alreadybeen jeopardised. The coordination of my present with myfuture was uppermost in my mind when I went to have teawith Prof. Ramanna.He did not take long to come to the point. The DevilMissile programme had been shelved in spite oftremendous achievements made by Narayanan and histeam at DRDL. The entire programme of military rocketswas reeling under a persistent apathy. The DRDO neededsomebody to take command of their missile programmeswhich had been stuck at the drawing board and static testbed stages for quite a while. Prof. Ramanna asked me if Iwould like to join DRDL and shoulder the responsibility ofshaping their Guided Missile Development Programme(GMDP). Prof. Ramanna’s proposal evoked a mixture ofemotions in me.When again would I have such an opportunity toconsolidate all our knowledge of rocketry and apply it?I felt honoured by the esteem in which Prof. Ramannaheld me. He had been the guiding spirit behind thePokharan nuclear test, and I was thrilled by the impact hehad helped create on the outside world about India’stechnical competence. I knew I would not be able to refusehim. Prof. Ramanna advised me to talk to Prof. Dhawan onthis issue so that he could work out the modalities of mytransfer from ISRO to DRDL.I met Prof. Dhawan on 14 January 1981. He gave me apatient hearing, with his typical penchant for weighingeverything carefully to make sure he didn’t miss a point. Amarkedly pleasant expression came to his face. He said, “Iam pleased with their appraisal of my man’s work”. He thensmiled. I have never met anyone with a smile quite like Prof.Dhawan’s—a soft white cloud—you could picture it in anyshape you wanted to.I wondered how I should proceed. “Should I formallyapply for the post so that DRDL could send theappointment order?” I enquired of Prof. Dhawan. “No. Don’tpressurise them. Let me talk to the top-level managementduring my next visit to New Delhi,” Prof. Dhawan said. “Iknow you have always had one foot in DRDO, now yourwhole centre of gravity seems to have shifted towardsthem.” Perhaps what Prof. Dhawan was telling me had anelement of truth in it, but my heart had always been at ISRO.Was he really unaware of that?Republic Day, 1981 brought with it a pleasant surprise.On the evening of 25 January, Mahadevan, Secretary toProf. UR Rao, rang up from Delhi to inform me about theHome Ministry announcement about the conferment of the'),\n",

I rejoiced with Prof. Dhawanat his receiving the Padma Vibhushan and I congratulatedhim wholeheartedly. I then rang up Dr Brahm Prakash andthanked him. Dr Brahm Prakash chided me for the formalityand said, “I feel as if my son has got the award.” I was sodeeply touched by Dr Brahm Prakash’s affection that Icould no longer keep my emotions in check.I filled my room with the music of Bismillah Khan’sshehnai. The music took me to another time, another place.I visited Rameswaram and hugged my mother. My fatherran his caring fingers through my hair. My mentor,Jallaluddin, announced the news to the crowd gathered onMosque Street. My sister, Zohara, prepared special sweetsfor me. Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry put a tilak on myforehead. Fr. Solomon blessed me holding the holy cross. Isaw Prof. Sarabhai smiling with a sense of achievement—the sapling which he had planted twenty years ago hadfinally grown into a tree whose fruits were beingappreciated by the people of India.My Padma Bhushan evoked mixed reactions at VSSC.While there were some who shared my happiness, therewere others who felt I was being unduly singled out forrecognition. Some of my close associates turned envious.Why do some people fail to see the great values of lifebecause of sadly twisted thought processes? Happiness,satisfaction, and success in life depend on making the rightchoices, the winning choices. There are forces in lifeworking for you and against you. One must distinguish thebeneficial forces from the malevolent ones and choosecorrectly between them.An inner voice told me that the time had come for a longfelt, but ignored, need for renewal. Let me clean my slateand write new ‘sums’. Were the earlier sums donecorrectly? Evaluating one’s own progress in life is not aneasy task. Here the student has to set his own questions,seek his own answers and evaluate them to his ownsatisfaction. Judgement aside, eighteen years at ISRO wastoo long a stay to leave without pain.

Many months went by,andmany letters were exchanged between ISRO andDRDO; and meetings were held in the secretariats of theDefence R&D establishment and the Department of Spaceto precipitate a mutually convenient course of action.Meanwhile, Prof. Ramanna retired from the office of theScientific Advisor to Defence Minister. Dr VSArunachalam, till then Director of the Defence MetallurgicalResearch Laboratory (DMRL) in Hyderabad, succeededProf. Ramanna. Dr Arunachalam was known for hisconfidence, and he cared little for the intricacies andnuances of the scientific bureaucracy. Meanwhile, Iunderstand that the Defence Minister at that time, RVenkataraman discussed the matter of my taking over themissile laboratory with Prof. Dhawan. Prof. Dhawan alsoseemed to be waiting for a decisive step at the highestlevel in the Defence Ministry. Overcoming the nigglingdoubts that had caused delays over the past year, thedecision to appoint me Director, DRDL was finally taken inFebruary, 1982.Prof. Dhawan used to visit my room in the ISROheadquarters and spend many hours in evolving spacelaunch vehicle projects. It was a great privilege to work withsuch a great scientist. Before I left ISRO, Prof. Dhawanasked me to give a talk on the Space Programme Profile inIndia by the year 2000. Almost the entire ISROmanagement and staff attended my talk, which was by wayof a farewell meeting.I had met Dr VS Arunachalam in 1976, when I visitedDMRL in connection with the aluminium alloy investmentcasting for the SLV inertial guidance platform. Taking it asa personal challenge, Dr Arunachalam had the investmentcasting, the first of its kind in the country, made in theincredibly short time of two months. His youthful energy andenthusiasm never failed to amaze me. This youngmetallurgist had within a short span of time lifted thescience of metal-making to the technology of metal-formingand then to the art of alloy development. With a tall andelegant figure, Dr Arunachalam was like an electricallycharged dynamo himself. I found him an unusually friendlyperson with a forceful manner, as well as an excellentworking partner.I visited DRDL in April 1982 to acquaint myself with mypotential work site. The Director of DRDL then, SL Bansal,took me around and introduced me to the senior scientistsin the laboratory. DRDL was working on five staff projectsand sixteen competence build-up projects. They were alsoinvolved in several technology-oriented activities with aview to gain lead time for the development of indigenousmissile systems in future. I was particularly impressed bytheir efforts on the twin 30-ton Liquid Propellant RocketEngine.Meanwhile, Anna University, Madras, conferred thehonorary degree of Doctor of Science on me. It had beennearly twenty years since I had acquired my degree inaeronautical engineering. I was happy that Anna Universityhad recognized my efforts in the field of rocketry, but whatpleased me most was the recognition of the value of ourwork in academic circles.

Very soon, I realizedthat this laboratory was still haunted by the winding up of theDevil missile project. Many excellent professionals had notyet recovered from the disappointment. People outside thescientific world may find it difficult to comprehend how ascientist feels when the umbilical cord to his work issuddenly snapped, for reasons totally alien to hisunderstanding and interests. The general mood and worktempo at DRDL reminded me of Samuel TaylorColeridge’s poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:Day after day, day after day,We stuck, nor breath, nor motion;As idle as a painted shipUpon a painted ocean.I found almost all my senior colleagues living with thepain of dashed hopes. There was a widespread feeling thatthe scientists of this laboratory had been cheated by thesenior officials in the Ministry of Defence. It was clear to methat the burial of the Devil was essential for the rise of hopeand vision.When about a month later, Admiral OS Dawson, thenthe Chief of Naval Staff, visited DRDL, I used it as anopportunity to make a point with my team. The TacticalCore Vehicle (TCV) project had been hanging fire for quitesome time. It was conceived as a single core vehicle withcertain common subsystems to meet the requirements ofthe services for a quick reaction Surface-to-Air Missile, ananti-radiation Air-to-Surface Missile which could belaunched from helicopters or fixed wing aircraft. Iemphasized the sea-skimming role of the core vehicle toAdmiral Dawson. I focussed not on its technical intricacies,but on its battlefield capabilities; and I highlighted theproduction plans. The message was loud and clear to mynew associates—do not make anything which you cannotsell later and do not spend your life on making one thingonly. Missile development is a multi-dimensional business—if you remain in any one dimension for a long time, youwill get stuck.My initial few months at DRDL were largely interactive. Ihad read at St. Joseph’s that an electron may appear as aparticle or wave depending on how you look at it. If you aska particle question, it will give you a particle answer; if youask a wave question, it will give you a wave answer. I notonly described and explained our goals, but also madethem an interplay between our work and ourselves. I stillrecall quoting Ronald Fischer at one of the meetings, “Thesweetness we taste in a piece of sugar is neither aproperty of the sugar nor a property of ourselves. We areproducing the experience of sweetness in the process ofinteracting with the sugar.”Very good work on a Surface-to-Surface missile with avertical riseturn straight line climb-ballistic path had beendone by that time. I was astonished to see thedetermination of the DRDL workforce, who, in spite of thepremature winding up of their earlier projects, were eagerto go ahead. I arranged reviews for its various subsystems,to arrive at precise specifications. To the horror of manyold-timers in DRDO, I started inviting people from the IndianInstitute of Science, Indian Institutes of Technology, Councilfor Scientific and Industrial Research, Tata Institute ofFundamental Research, and many other educationalinstitutions where related experts could be found. I felt thatthe stuffy work centres of DRDL needed a breath of fresh'),\n",

Once we opened the windows wide, the light ofscientific talent began to pour in. Once more, Coleridge’sAncient Mariner came to mind: “Swiftly, swiftly flew theship,\\\\ Riding gently the oncoming tide.”Sometime in the beginning of 1983, Prof. Dhawanvisited DRDL. I reminded him of his own advice to mealmost a decade ago: “You have to dream before yourdreams can come true. Some people stride towardswhatever it is that they want in life; others shuffle their feetand never get started because they do not know what theywant—and do not know how to find it either.” ISRO waslucky to have had Prof. Sarabhai and Prof. Dhawan at thehelm—leaders who elucidated their goals, made theirmissions larger than their lives, and could then inspire theirentire workforce. DRDL had not been so lucky. Thisexcellent laboratory played a truncated role that did notreflect its existing or potential capabilities or even fulfill theexpectations in South Block. I told Prof. Dhawan about thehighly professional, but slightly bewildered team I had. Prof.Dhawan responded with his characteristic broad smilewhich could be interpreted in any way one chose.In order to accelerate the pace of R&D activities atDRDL, it was imperative that decisions on vital scientific,technical and technological problems be taken quickly.Throughout my career I had zealously pursued openness inscientific matters. I had seen from very close quarters thedecay and disintegration that go with management throughclosed-door consultations and secret manipulations. Ialways despised and resisted such efforts.

Thus, a highlevel body called the Missile Technology Committee wasformed within DRDL. The concept of management byparticipation was evoked and earnest efforts were made toinvolve middle-level scientists and engineers in themanagement activities of the laboratory.Days of debate and weeks of thinking finally culminatedin the longterm ‘Guided Missile Development Programme’.I had read somewhere, “Know where you are going. Thegreat thing in the world is not knowing so much where westand, as in what direction we are moving.” What if we didnot have the technological might of the Western countries,we knew we had to attain that might, and this determinationwas our driving force. To draw up a clear and well-definedmissile development programme for the production ofindigenous missiles, a committee was constituted undermy chairmanship. The members were ZP Marshall, then theChief of Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, NR Iyer, AKKapoor and KS Venkataraman. We drafted a paper for theperusal of the Cabinet Committee for Political Affairs(CCPA). The paper was given its final shape afterconsulting the representatives of the three DefenceServices. We estimated an expenditure of about Rs 390crores, spread over a period of twelve years.Development programmes often get stuck by the timethey reach the production stage, mainly because of lack offunding. We wanted to get funds to develop and producetwo missiles—a low-level quick reaction Tactical CoreVehicle and a Medium Range Surface-to-Surface WeaponSystem. We planned to make a surface-to-air mediumrange weapon system with multi-target handling capabilityduring the second phase. DRDL had been known for itspioneering work in the field of anti-tank missiles. Weproposed to develop a third generation anti-tank guidedmissile having ‘fire-and-forget’ capabilities. All mycolleagues were pleased with the proposal. They saw anopportunity to pursue afresh activities initiated long ago.But I was not entirely satisfied. I longed to revive my burieddream of a Re-entry Experiment Launch Vehicle (REX). Ipersuaded my colleagues to take up a technologydevelopment project to generate data for use in the designof heat shields. These shields were required for building upcapability to make longrange missiles in the future.I made a presentation in the South Block. Thepresentation was presided over by the Defence Minister ofthe time R Venkataraman, and attended by the threeService Chiefs: General Krishna Rao, Air Chief MarshalDilbagh Singh and Admiral Dawson. The CabinetSecretary, Krishna Rao Sahib, Defence Secretary, SMGhosh and Secretary, Expenditure, R Ganapathy werepresent. Everyone seemed to have all sorts of doubts—about our capabilities, about the feasibility and availabilityof required technological infrastructure, about the viability,the schedule and cost.

Although somequestioned our ambitious proposal, everyone, even thedoubting Thomases, were very excited about the idea ofIndia having her own missile systems.

But when he suggested that welaunch an integrated guided missile developmentprogramme, instead of making missiles in phases, wecould not believe our ears.We were quite dumbfounded by the Defence Minister’ssuggestion. After a long pause, Dr Arunachalam replied,“We beg for time to rethink and return, Sir!” “You comeback tomorrow morning please,” the Defence Ministerreplied. It was reminiscent of Prof. Sarabhai’s zeal andvision. That night, Dr Arunachalam and I laboured togetheron reworking our plan.We worked out some very important extensions andimprovements in our proposal, taking all the variables, suchas design, fabrication, system integration, qualification,experimental flights, evaluation, updating, user trials,producibility, quality, reliability, and financial viability intoaccount. We then integrated them into a single function oftotal accountability, in order to meet the needs of thecountry’s armed forces with an indigenous endeavour. Weworked out the concepts of design, development,production concurrency and proposed the participation ofuser and inspection agencies right from the drawing-boardstage. We also suggested a methodology to achieve state-of-the-art systems after all the years of developmentalactivities. We wanted to deliver contemporary missiles toour Services and not some outdated inventory of weapons.It was a very exciting challenge that had been thrown to us.By the time we finished our work, it was alreadymorning. Suddenly, at the breakfast table, I rememberedthat I was to attend my niece Zameela’s wedding atRameswaram that evening. I thought it was already too lateto do anything. Even if I could catch the Madras flight later inthe day, how would I reach Rameswaram from there? Therewas no air link between Madras and Madurai from where Icould board the evening train to Rameswaram. A pang ofguilt dampened my spirits. Was it fair, I asked myself, toforget my family commitments and obligations? Zameelawas more like a daughter to me. The thought of missing herwedding because of professional preoccupations at Delhiwas very distressing. I finished breakfast and left for themeeting.When we met Defence Minister Venkataraman andshowed him our revised proposal, he was visibly pleased.The proposal of the missile development project had beenturned overnight into the blueprint of an integratedprogramme with far-reaching consequences. It would havewide-ranging technological spinoffs, and was exactly whatthe Defence Minister had had in mind the previous evening.Notwithstanding the great respect I had for the DefenceMinister, I was not really sure if he would clear our entireproposal. But he did. I was absolutely delighted!The Defence Minister stood up, signalling that themeeting was over. Turning to me he said, “Since I broughtyou here, I was expecting you to come up with somethinglike this. I am happy to see your work.” In a split second, themystery surrounding the clearance of my appointment asDirector DRDL in 1982 was cleared. So it was DefenceMinister Venkataraman who had brought me in! Bowing inthanks, I turned towards the door when I heard DrArunachalam telling the Minister about Zameela’s weddingbeing scheduled for that evening at Rameswaram. Itamazed me that Dr Arunachalam should bring up thismatter before the Minister. Why would a person of his'),\n",

Iwas overwhelmed when the Defence Minister located anAir Force helicopter doing sorties between Madras andMadurai later in the day to take me to Madurai as soon as Idisembarked at Madras from the regular Indian Airlinesflight, which was leaving Delhi in an hour’s time. DrArunachalam told me, “You have earned this for your hardwork of the last six months.”Flying towards Madras, I scribbled on the back of myboarding pass:Who never climbed the weary league –Can such a foot exploreThe purple territoriesOn Rameswaram’s shore?The Air Force helicopter landed close to the IndianAirlines aircraft as soon as it arrived from Delhi.

I was in Rameswaramwell in time for Zameela’s wedding. I blessed my brother’sdaughter with a father’s love.The Defence Minister put up our proposal before theCabinet and saw it through. His recommendations on ourproposal were accepted and an unprecedented amount ofRs 388 crores was sanctioned for this purpose. Thus wasborn India’s prestigious Integrated Guided MissileDevelopment Programme, later abbreviated to IGMDP.When I presented the government sanction letter beforethe Missile Technology Committee at DRDL, they wereenthused with fire and action. The proposed projects werechristened in accordance with the spirit of India’s self-reliance. Thus the Surface-to-Surface weapon systembecame Prithvi (“the Earth”) and the Tactical Core Vehiclewas called Trishul (the trident of Lord Shiva). The Surface-to-Air area defence system was named as Akash (“sky”)and the anti-tank missile project Nag (“Cobra”). I gave thename Agni (“Fire”) to my long cherished dream of REX. DrArunachalam came to DRDL and formally launched theIGMDP on 27 July 1983. It was a great event in which everysingle employee of DRDL participated. Everybody whowas somebody in Indian Aerospace Research was invited.A large number of scientists from other laboratories andorganizations, professors from academic institutions,representatives of the armed forces, production centres,and inspection authorities, who were our business partnersnow, were present on this occasion. A closed-circuit TVnetwork had to be pressed into operation to ensure propercommunication between the participants for we had nosingle place to accommodate all the invitees.

Missile Technology had beenconsidered the domain of a few selected nations in theworld. Peoplewere curious to see how, with what India had at thatpoint of time, we were going to achieve all that waspromised. The magnitude of the IGMDP was reallyunprecedented in the country and the schedules projectedwere quite quixotic by the norms and standards prevailingin the Indian R&D establishments. I was fully aware thatobtaining sanction for the programme could at best beseen as only ten per cent of the work done. To get it goingwould be quite a different matter altogether. The more youhave, the more there is to maintain. Now that we had beengiven all the necessary money and freedom to proceed, Ihad to take my team forward and fulfill the promises I hadmade.What would be needed to realise this missileprogramme, from the design to the deployment stages?Excellent manpower was available; money had beensanctioned; and some infrastructure also existed. Whatwas lacking then? What else does a project need tosucceed apart from these three vital inputs? From my SLV-3 experience, I thought I knew the answer. The crux wasgoing to be out mastery over missile technology. I expectednothing from abroad. Technology is a group activity and wewould need leaders who could not only put their heart andsoul into the missile programme, but also carry along withthem hundreds of other engineers and scientists. We knewwe had to be prepared to encounter numerouscontradictions and procedural absurdities that wereprevalent in the participating laboratories. We would haveto counteract the existing attitudes of our public sectorunits, which believed that their performance would never betested. The whole system—its people, procedures,infrastructure—would have to learn to extend itself. Wedecided to achieve something that was way beyond ourcollective national capability and I, for one, had no illusionsabout the fact that unless our teams worked on the basis ofproportion or probability, nothing would be achieved.The most remarkable thing about DRDL was its largepool of highly talented people, many of whom were,unfortunately, full of egotism and rebelliousness.Unfortunately, they had not even accumulated enoughexperience to make them confident about their ownjudgement. On the whole, they would discuss matters veryenthusiastically, but would finally accept what a select fewsaid. They would unquestioningly believe in outsidespecialists.A particularly interesting person I met in DRDL was AVRanga Rao. He was very articulate and had an impressivepersonality. His usual garb consisted of a red neck-tie witha checked coat and loose trousers. He would wear this inthe hot climate of Hyderabad, where even a longsleevedshirt and shoes are considered an avoidableinconvenience. With his thick white beard and a pipeclamped between his teeth, there was a certain auraaround this extremely gifted, but rather egocentricindividual.I consulted Ranga Rao on revamping the existingmanagement system to achieve an optimum utilization ofhuman resources.

After prolonged discussions, wedecided to reorganize the laboratory into a technology-oriented structure. We needed to accommodate a matrixtype of structure for the execution of various activitiesneeded for the projects. In less than four months, fourhundred scientists began to work on the missileprogramme.During this period, the most important task before mewas the selection of the Project Directors to lead individualmissile projects. We had a very large pool of talent. In fact,it was a market of plenty. The question was whom to pick—a go-getter, a planner, a maverick, a dictator or a teamman? I had to get the right type of leader who could clearlyvisualize the goal, and channelise the energies of his teammembers who would be working at different work centres inpursuit of their own individual goals.It was a difficult game, some rules of which I had learntwhile working on ISRO’s high priority projects for twodecades. The wrong choice would jeopardise the entirefuture of the programme. I had a detailed discussion with alarge number of prospective scientists and engineers. Iwanted these five Project Directors to train another twenty-five project directors and team leaders of tomorrow.Many of my senior colleagues—naming them would beunfair, because it could be only my imagination—tried tobefriend me during this period. I respected their concern fora lonely man, but avoided any close contacts. Throughloyalty to a friend one can be easily led into doingsomething that is not in the best interests of theorganization.Perhaps the main motive behind my isolation was mydesire to escape from the demands of relationships, whichI consider very difficult in comparison to making rockets. AllI desired was to be true to my way of life, to uphold thescience of rocketry in my country and to retire with a cleanconscience. I took quite some time and did a lot of hardthinking to decide who should lead the five projects. Iexamined the working styles of many scientists beforemaking my decision. I think some of my observations mayinterest you.A basic aspect of a person’s working style is how heplans and organizes tasks. At one extreme is the cautiousplanner, who carefully spells out each step before makingany move. With a sharp eye for what can possibly gowrong, he tries to cover all contingencies. At the other endis the fast mover, who weaves and dodges without a plan.Inspired by an idea, the fast mover is always ready foraction.Another aspect of a person’s working style is control—the energy and attention devoted to ensuring that thingshappen in a certain way. At one extreme is the tightcontroller, a strict administrator with frequent checkpoints.Rules and policies are to be followed with religious fervour.At the opposite end are those who move with freedom andflexibility. They have little patience for bureaucracy. Theydelegate easily and give their subordinates wide latitudefor movement. I wanted leaders who tread the middle path,those who could control without stifling dissent or beingrigid.I wanted men who had the capability to grow withpossibilities, with the patience to explore all possiblealternatives, with the wisdom to apply old principles to newsituations; people with the skill to negotiate their wayforward. I wanted them to be accommodating, to be willing'),\n",

Above all, they should beable to take failure in their stride and share in both successand failure.My search for someone to lead the Prithvi project endedwith Col VJ Sundaram who belonged to the EME Corps ofthe Indian Army. With a post-graduate degree inAeronautical Engineering and expertise in mechanicalvibrations, Sundaram was head of the Structures Group atDRDL. I found in him a readiness to experiment with newways of resolving conflicting points of view. He was anexperimenter and innovator in team work. He had anextraordinary capability for evaluating alternative ways ofoperating. He would suggest moving forward into newterrains that could lead to a solution which had not beenperceived earlier. Though a particular goal might be clearto a project leader, and he may be capable of givingadequate directions for accomplishing it, there can beresistance from subordinates if the goal makes no sense tothem. Therein lies the importance of a leader who provideseffective work directions. I thought the Project Director ofPrithvi would be the first to make decisions with productionagencies and the armed forces, and Sundaram would bethe ideal choice to see that sound decisions were taken.For Trishul, I was looking for a man who not only had asound knowledge of electronics and missile warfare, butwho could also communicate the complexities to his teamin order to promote understanding and to earn his team’ssupport. I found in Cmde SR Mohan, who sailed intoDefence R&D from the Indian Navy, a talent for detail andan almost magical power of persuasion.For Agni, my dream project, I needed somebody whowould tolerate my occasional meddling in the running of thisproject. In RN Agarwal I found the right person. He was analumnus of MIT with a brilliant academic record and hadbeen managing the Aeronautical Test Facilities at DRDLwith keen professional acumen.Due to technological complexities, Akash and Nagwere then considered missiles of the future; their activitieswere expected to peak about half a decade later.Therefore, I selected the relatively young Prahlada and NRIyer for Akash and Nag. Two other young men, VKSaraswat and AK Kapoor were made deputies toSundaram and Mohan respectively.In those days, there was no forum in DRDL whereissues of general importance could be openly discussedand decisions debated. Scientists, it must be remembered,are basically emotional people. Once they stumble, it isdifficult for them to pull themselves together. Setbacks anddisappointments have always been and always will be aninherent part of any career, even one in science. However, Idid not want any of my scientists to face disappointmentsalone. I also wanted to ensure that none of them set theirgoals when they were at a low ebb. To avoid sucheventualities a Science Council was created—a sort ofpanchayat where the community would sit together andtake common decisions. Every three months, all scientists—juniors and seniors, veterans and freshers— would sittogether and let off steam.The very first meeting of the Council was eventful. Aftera spell of half-hearted enquiries and expressions of doubt,one senior scientist, MN Rao, shot a straight question: “On'),\n",

In my opinion, aproductive leader must be very competent in staffing. Heshould continually introduce new blood into theorganization. He must be adept at dealing with problemsand new concepts. The problems encountered by an R&Dorganization typically involve trade-offs among a widevariety of known and unknown parameters. Skill in handlingthese complex entities is important in achieving highproductivity. The leader must be capable of instillingenthusiasm in his team. He should give appropriate creditwhere it is due; praise publicly, but criticize privately.One of the most difficult questions came from a youngscientist: “How are you going to stop these projects fromgoing the Devil way?” I explained to him the philosophybehind IGMDP—it begins with design and ends indeployment. The participation of the production centres anduser agencies right from the design stage had beenensured and there was no question of going back till themissile systems had been successfully deployed in thebattlefield.While the process of forming teams and organizingwork was going on, I found that the space available atDRDL was grossly inadequate to meet the enhancedrequirements of IGMDP. Some of the facilities would haveto be located at a nearby site. The missile integration andcheckout facility built during the Devil phase consisted onlyof a 120 sq. metre shed thickly populated with pigeons.Where was the space and the facility to integrate the fivemissiles which would arrive here shortly? TheEnvironmental Test Facility and the Avionics Laboratorywere equally cramped and ill-equipped. I visited the nearbyImarat Kancha area. It used to be the test range for anti-tank missiles developed by DRDL decades ago. Theterrain was barren—there were hardly any trees— anddotted with large boulders typical of the Deccan plateau. Ifelt as if there was some tremendous energy trapped inthese stones. I decided to locate the integration and check-out facilities needed for the missile projects here. For thenext three years, this became my mission.We drew up a proposal to establish a model hightechnology research centre with very advanced technicalfacilities like an inertial instrumentation laboratory, full-scaleenvironmental and electronic warfare (EMI/EMC) testfacilities, a composites production centre, high enthalpyfacility, and a state-of-the-art missile integration andcheckout centre. By any standards, this was a gigantictask. An altogether different brand of expertise, grit anddetermination were required to realise this project. Goalsand objectives had already been decided upon. Now theyhad to be shared with a large number of people fromvarious agencies, through the problem-solving andcommunication processes that the leader of the team mustbuild and maintain.

They said it would take fiveyears to complete the task. The matter was discussed indepth at the highest level in the Ministry of Defence and alandmark decision to entrust the responsibility of buildingdefence structures to an outside construction company wastaken. We liaised with the Survey of India and the NationalRemote Sensing Agency for the inspection of the contourmaps and for obtaining aerial photographs of the ImaratKancha to prepare a layout for the approach roads and thelocation of the facilities. The Central Ground Water Boardidentified twenty locations amid the rocks to tap water.Infrastructure to provide 40 MVA power and 5 million litresof water per day was planned.It was also at this time that Col SK Salwan, amechanical engineer with boundless energy, joined us. Inthe final phase of construction, Salwan discovered anancient place of worship among the boulders. It seemed tome that this place was blessed.Now that we had started working on the design of themissile systems and development had already commencedfor their integration and checkout, the next logical step wasto look for a suitable site for the missile flight trials. WithSHAR also in Andhra Pradesh, the search for a suitablesite spread towards the eastern coastline and finally endedat Balasore in Orissa. A site along the north-eastern coastwas identified for a National Test Range. Unfortunately theentire project ran into rough weather because of thepolitical issues raised around the evacuation of peopleliving in that area. We decided therefore to create aninterim infrastructure adjacent to the Proof ExperimentalEstablishment (PXE) at Chandipur in Balasore district ofOrissa. A funding of Rs 30 crores had been given toconstruct the range, called the Interim Test Range (ITR). DrHS Rama Rao and his team did an excellent job of workingout innovative and cost-effective specifications for electro-optical tracking instruments, a tracking telescope systemand an instrumentation tracking radar. Lt Gen RS Deswaland Maj Gen KN Singh took charge of creating the launchpad and range infrastructure. There was a beautiful birdsanctuary in Chandipur. I asked the engineers to design thetest range without disturbing it.Creating the RCI was perhaps the most satisfyingexperience of my life. Developing this centre of excellenceof missile technology was akin to the joy of a potter shapingartifacts of lasting beauty from the mundane clay.Defence Minister R Venkataraman visited DRDL inSeptember 1983 to appraise himself of the activities ofIGMDP. He advised us to list all the resources we neededto achieve our goals, overlooking nothing, and then includein the list our own positive imagination and faith. “What youimagine, is what will transpire. What you believe is what youwill achieve,” he said. Both Dr Arunachalam and I saw inthe horizon endless possibilities stretching out beforeIGMDP; and our enthusiasm proved infectious.

He had nurtured the institutionwhen it most needed nourishment. Dr Brahm Prakashplayed a very important role in shaping my leadership skills.In fact my association with him was a turning point in mylife. His humility mellowed me and helped me discard myaggressive approach. His humility did not consist merely inbeing modest about his talents or virtues, but in respectingthe dignity of all those who worked under him and inrecognizing the fact that no one is infallible, not even theleader. He was an intellectual giant with a frail constitution;he had a childlike innocence and I always considered him asaint among scientists.During this period of renaissance at DRDL, an altitudecontrol system and an on-board computer developed by PBanerjee, KV Ramana Sai and their team was almostready. The success of this effort was very vital for anyindigenous missile development programme. All the same,we had to have a missile to test this important system.After many brainstorming sessions, we decided toimprovise a Devil missile to test the system. A Devil missilewas dis-assembled, many modifications made, extensivesubsystem testing was done and the missile checkoutsystem was reconfigured.

She also told me thatthe emphasis of the IGMDP should be not only on schedulebut also on the pursuance of excellence. “No matter whatyou achieve, you should never be completely satisfied andshould always be searching for ways to prove yourself,” sheadded. Within a month, she demonstrated her interest andsupport by sending the newly appointed Defence Minister,SB Chavan, to review our projects. Shrimati Gandhi’sfollow-up approach was not only impressive, it waseffective too. Today, everyone associated with aerospaceresearch in our country knows that excellence issynonymous with the IGMDP.We had our home-grown, but effective, managementtechniques. One such technique was concerned with follow-up of project activities. It basically consisted of analysingthe technical as well as procedural applicability of apossible solution, testing it with the work centres,discussing it with the general body of associates andimplementing it after enlisting everybody’s support.

Through follow-up on the work done at differentlaboratories on design, planning, supporting services, andby the inspection agencies and academic institutions, rapidprogress has been achieved in the most harmoniousmanner. In fact, the work code in the Guided MissileProgramme Office was: if you need to write a letter to awork centre, send a fax; if you need to send a telex or fax,telephone; and if the need arises for telephonicdiscussions, visit the place personally.The power of this approach came to light when DrArunachalam conducted a comprehensive status review ofIGMDP on 27 September 1984. Experts from DRDOLaboratories, ISRO, academic institutions, and productionagencies gathered to critically review the progress madeand problems faced in the first year of implementation.Major decisions like the creation of facilities at ImaratKancha and the establishment of a test facility werecrystallized during the review. The future infrastructure at theImarat Kancha was given the name of Research CentreImarat (RCI), retaining the original identity of the place.It was a pleasure to find an old acquaintance, TNSeshan, on the review board. Between SLV-3 and now, wehad developed a mutual affection. However, this time asthe Defence Secretary, Seshan’s queries about theschedules and viability of financial propositions presentedwere much more pointed. Seshan is a person who enjoysverbally bringing adversaries to their knees. Using hissharp-edged humour, Seshan would make his opponentslook ridiculous. Although he is prone to be loud and can turnargumentative on occasions, in the end he would alwaysensure maximization of all available resources towards asolution that was within implementation. At a personal level,Seshan is a very kind-hearted and considerate person. Myteam was particularly pleased to answer his questionsabout the advanced technology employed in the IGMDP. Istill remember his uncanny curiosity about the indigenousdevelopment of carbon-carbon composites. And to let youinto a small secret—Seshan is perhaps the only person inthe world who enjoys calling me by my full name which'),\n",

In fact, more than 50 professorsand 100 research scholars worked on missile-relatedproblems in the laboratories of their respective institutes.The quality of work achieved through this partnership in thatone year had given me tremendous confidence that anydevelopment task could be undertaken within the country solong as we have our focussed schedules. Four monthsbefore this review, I think it was during April–June 1984, sixof us in the missile programme visited academiccampuses and enlisted promising young graduates. Wepresented an outline of the missile programme before theprofessors and the aspiring students, about 350 of them,and requested them to participate. I informed the reviewersthat we were expecting around 300 young engineers to joinour laboratories.Roddam Narasimha, then Director of the NationalAeronautical Laboratory, used the occasion of this reviewto put up a strong case for technology initiative. He citedthe experiences of the green revolution, which haddemonstrated beyond doubt that if the goals were clear,there was enough talent available in the country to tacklemajor technological challenges.When India carried out its first nuclear explosion forpeaceful purposes, we declared ourselves the sixth countryin the world to explode a nuclear device. When welaunched SLV-3 we were the fifth country to achievesatellite launch capability. When were we going to be thefirst or second country in the world to achieve atechnological feat?I listened carefully to the review members as they airedtheir opinions and doubts, and I learned from their collectivewisdom. It was indeed a great education for me. Ironically,all through school, we were taught to read, write and speak,but never to listen, and the situation remains much thesame today. Traditionally, Indian scientists have been verygood speakers, but have inadequately developed listeningskills. We made a resolution to be attentive listeners. Areengineering structures not built on the foundation offunctional utility? Does technical know-how not form itsbricks? And, are these bricks not put together with themortar of constructive criticism? The foundation had beenlaid, the bricks baked, and now the mortar to cement ouract together was being mixed.We were working on the action plan that had emergedfrom the earlier month’s review, when the news of ShrimatiGandhi’s assassination broke. This was followed by thenews of widespread violence and riots. A curfew had beenimposed in Hyderabad city. We rolled up the PERT chartsand a city map was spread out over the table to organizetransport and safe passage for all employees. In less thanan hour, the laboratory wore a deserted look. I was leftsitting alone in my office. The circumstances of ShrimatiGandhi’s death were very ominous. The memories of hervisit barely three months ago further deepened my pain.Why should great people meet with such horrific ends?

I kept thinking about the loomof the broken thread.Shrimati Gandhi’s death was a tremendous loss to thescientific community. She had given impetus to scientificresearch in the country. But India is a very resilient nation. Itgradually absorbed the shock of Shrimati Gandhi’sassassination, although at the cost of thousands of livesand a colossal loss of property. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, tookover as the new Prime Minister of India. He went to thepolls and obtained a mandate from the people to carryforward the policies of Mrs. Gandhi, the Integrated GuidedMissile Development Programme being a part of them.By the summer of 1985, all the groundwork had beencompleted for building the Missile Technology ResearchCentre at Imarat Kancha. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi laidthe foundation stone of the Research Centre Imarat (RCI)on 3 August 1985. He appeared very pleased with theprogress made. There was a child-like curiosity in himwhich was very engaging. The grit and determinationdisplayed by his mother when she visited us a year agowas also present in him, although with a small difference.Madam Gandhi was a taskmaster, whereas Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhi used his charisma to achieve his ends. Hetold the DRDL family that he realised the hardships facedby Indian scientists and expressed his gratitude towardsthose who preferred to stay back and work in theirmotherland rather than go abroad for comfortable careers.He said that nobody could concentrate on work of this typeunless he was free from the trivialities of daily life, andassured us that whatever necessary would be done tomake scientists’ lives more comfortable.Within a week of his visit, I left for the USA with DrArunachalam on an invitation from the United States AirForce. Roddam Narasimha of National AeronauticalLaboratory and KK Ganapathy of HAL accompanied us.After finishing our work at the Pentagon in Washington, welanded in San Francisco on our way to Los Angeles to visitNorthrop Corporation. I utilized this opportunity to visit theCrystal Cathedral built by my favourite author, RobertSchuller. I was amazed by the sheer beauty of this all-glass,four-pointed, star-shaped structure that is more than 400feet from one point to another. The glass roof which is 100feet longer than a football field seemed to float in space.This Cathedral has been built at the cost of several milliondollars through donations organized by Schuller. “God cando tremendous things through the person who doesn’t careabout who gets the credit. The ego involvement must go,”writes Schuller. “Before God trusts you with success, youhave to prove yourself humble enough to handle the bigprize.” I prayed to God in Schuller’s church to help me builda Research Centre at the Imarat Kancha—that would be myCrystal Cathedral.* * *'),\n",

It was a valuable experience for all ofus. We were now in a position to develop, through theseyoung teams, a re-entry technology and structure, amillimetric wave radar, a phased array radar, rocketsystems and other such equipment. When we first assignedthese tasks to the young scientists, they did not fully graspthe importance of their work. Once they did, they felt uneasyunder the burden of the tremendous faith placed in them. Istill remember one young man telling me, “There is no bigshot in our team, how will we be able to break through?” Itold him, “A big shot is a little shot who keeps on shooting,so keep trying.” It was astonishing to see how in the youngscientific environment, negative attitudes changed topositive and things that were previously thought impracticalbegan happening. Many older scientists were rejuvenatedsimply by being part of a young team.It has been my personal experience that the true flavour,the real fun, the continuous excitement of work lie in theprocess of doing it rather than in having it over and donewith. To return to the four basic factors that I am convincedare involved in successful outcomes: goal-setting, positivethinking, visualizing, and believing.By now, we had gone through an elaborate exercise ofgoal-setting and enthused the young scientists about thesegoals. At the review meetings, I would insist that theyoungest scientists present their team’s work. That wouldhelp them in visualizing the whole system. Gradually, anatmosphere of confidence grew. Young scientists startedquestioning senior colleagues on solid technical issues.Nothing daunted them, because they feared nothing. If therewere doubts, they rose above them. They soon becamepersons of power. A person with belief never grovelsbefore anyone, whining and whimpering that it’s all toomuch, that he lacks support, that he is being treatedunfairly. Instead, such a person tackles problems head onand then affirms, ‘As a child of God, I am greater thananything that can happen to me’. I tried to keep the workenvironment lively with a good blend of the experience ofthe older scientists mixed with the skills of their youngercolleagues. This positive dependence between youth andexperience had created a very productive work culture atDRDL.The first launch of the Missile Programme wasconducted on 16 September 1985, when Trishul took offfrom the test range at Sriharikota (SHAR). It was a ballisticflight meant for testing the inflight performance of the solidpropellant rocket motor. Two C-Band radars and Kalidieo-theodolite (KTLs) were used to track the missile from theground. The test was successful. The launcher, rocketmotor and telemetry systems functioned as planned. Theaerodynamic drag however was higher than the estimatespredicted on the basis of wind tunnel testing. In terms oftechnology breakthrough or experience enrichment, thistest was of little value but the real achievement of this testwas to remind my DRDL friends that they could fly missileswithout being driven by the brute demands of complianceor reverse engineering. In a swift stroke, the psyche of theDRDL scientists experienced a multi-dimensionalexpansion.This was followed by the successful test flight of thePilotless Target Aircraft (PTA). Our engineers haddeveloped the rocket motor for the PTA designed by the'),\n",

The motor had been type- approvedby DTD&P (Air). This was a small but significant steptowards developing missile hardware that is not onlyfunctional but also acceptable to the user agencies. Aprivate sector firm was engaged to produce a reliable,airworthy, high thrust-to-weight ratio rocket motor withtechnology input from DRDL. We were slowly graduatingfrom single laboratory projects to multi-laboratoryprogrammes to laboratory-industry exercises. Thedevelopment of PTA symbolized a great confluence of fourdifferent organizations. I felt as if I was standing at ameeting point and looking at the roads coming from ADE,DTD&P (Air) and ISRO. The fourth road was the DRDL, ahighway to national self-reliance in missile technology.Taking our partnership with the academic institutions ofthe country a step further, Joint Advanced TechnologyProgrammes were started at the Indian Institute of Science(IISc), and Jadavpur University. I have always had a deepregard for academic institutions and reverence for excellentacademicians. I value the inputs that academicians canmake to development. Formal requests had been placedwith these institutions and arrangements arrived at underwhich expertise from their faculties would be extended toDRDL in pursuance of its projects.Let me highlight a few contributions of academicinstitutions to the various missile systems. Prithvi had beendesigned as an inertially guided missile. To reach thetarget accurately, the trajectory parameters have to beloaded into its brain—an on-board computer. A team ofyoung engineering graduates at Jadavpur University underthe guidance of Prof. Ghoshal developed the requiredrobust guidance algorithm. At the IISc, postgraduatestudents under the leadership of Prof. IG Sharmadeveloped air defence software for multi-target acquisitionby Akash. The re- entry vehicle system design methodologyfor Agni was developed by a young team at IIT Madras andDRDO scientists. Osmania University’s NavigationalElectronics Research and Training Unit had developedstateof-the-art signal processing algorithms for Nag. I haveonly given a few examples of collaborative endeavour. Infact, it would have been very difficult to achieve ouradvanced technological goals without the activepartnership of our academic institutions.Let us consider the example of the Agni payloadbreakthrough. Agni is a two-stage rocket system andemploys re-entry technology developed in the country forthe first time. It is boosted by a first-stage solid rocketmotor derived from SLV-3 and further accelerated at thesecond stage with the liquid rocket engines of Prithvi. Forthe Agni, the payload gets delivered at hypersonic speeds,which calls for the design and development of a re-entryvehicle structure. The payload with guidance electronics ishoused in the re-entry vehicle structure, which is meant toprotect the payload by keeping the inside temperaturewithin the limit of 40oC, when the outside skin temperatureis greater than 2500oC. An inertial guidance system withan on-board computer guides the payload to the requiredtarget. For any re-entry missile system, three-dimensionalpreforms are core material for making the carbon-carbonnose tip that will remain strong even at such hightemperatures. Four laboratories of DRDO and the CSIRachieved this in a short span of 18 months— somethingother countries could do only after a decade of researchand development!Another challenge involved in the Agni payload design'),\n",

In fact, Agni would re-enter theatmosphere at twelve times the speed of sound (12 Mach,as we call it in science). At this tremendous speed, we hadno experience of how to keep the vehicle under control. Tocarry out a test, we had no wind tunnel to generate that kindof speed. If we sought American help, we would have beenseen as aspiring to something they considered theirexclusive privilege. Even if they consented to co-operate,they would be certain to quote a price for their wind tunnelgreater than our entire project budget. Now, the questionwas how to beat the system. Prof. SM Deshpande of theIISc found four young, bright scientists working in the field offluid dynamics and, within six months, developed thesoftware for Computational Fluid Dynamics for HypersonicRegimes, which is one of its kind in the world.Another achievement was the development of a missiletrajectory simulation software, ANUKALPANA by Prof. IGSharma of IISc to evaluate multi-target acquisitioncapabilities of an Akash-type weapon system. No countrywould have given us this kind of software, but wedeveloped it indigenously.In yet another example of creating a synergy of scientifictalent, Prof. Bharati Bhatt of IIT Delhi, working with the SolidPhysics Laboratory (SPL) and Central Electronics Limited(CEL), broke the monopoly of the western countries bydeveloping ferrite phase shifters for use in the multi-function, multi-tasking 3-D Phased Army Radar forsurveillence, tracking and guidance of Akash. Prof. Saraf ofIIT, Kharagpur, working with BK Mukho-padhyay, mycolleague at RCI, made a millimetric wave (MMW) antennafor the Nag Seeker Head in two years, a record even byinternational standards. The Central Electrical andElectronics Research Institute (CEERI), Pilani developedan Impatt Diode in consortium with the SPL and RCI toovercome technological foreign dependence in creatingthese components, which are the heart of any MMWdevice.As work on the project spread horizontally, performanceappraisal became more and more difficult. DRDO has anassessment-linked policy. Leading nearly 500 scientists, Ihad to finalize their performance appraisals in the form ofAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs). These reports wouldbe forwarded to an assessment board comprised ofoutside specialists for recommendations. Many peopleviewed this part of my job uncharitably. Missing apromotion was conveniently translated as a dislike I hadtowards them. Promotions of other colleagues were seenas subjective favours granted by me. Entrusted with thetask of performance evaluation, I had to be a fair judge.To truly understand a judge, you must understand theriddle of the scales; one side heaped high with hope, theother side holding apprehension. When the scales dip,bright optimism turns into silent panic.When a person looks at himself, he is likely to misjudgewhat he finds. He sees only his intentions. Most peoplehave good intentions and hence conclude that whateverthey are doing is good. It is difficult for an individual toobjectively judge his actions, which may be, and often are,contradictory to his good intentions. Most people come towork with the intention of doing it. Many of them do theirwork in a manner they find convenient and leave for homein the evening with a sense of satisfaction. They do notevaluate their performance, only their intentions. It isassumed that because an individual has worked with the'),\n",

He had nointention of causing the delay. But if his action or inactioncaused that delay, was it not intentional?Looking back on my days as a young scientist, I amaware that one of the most constant and powerful urges Iexperienced was my desire to be more than what I was atthat moment. I desired to feel more, learn more, expressmore. I desired to grow, improve, purify, expand. I neverused any outside influence to advance my career. All I hadwas the inner urge to seek more within myself. The key tomy motivation has always been to look at how far I had stillto go rather than how far I had come. After all, what is lifebut a mixture of unsolved problems, ambiguous victories,and amorphous defeats?The trouble is that we often merely analyse life insteadof dealing with it. People dissect their failures for causesand effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experienceto master them and thereby avoid their recurrence. This ismy belief: that through difficulties and problems God givesus the opportunity to grow. So when your hopes anddreams and goals are dashed, search among thewreckage, you may find a golden opportunity hidden in theruins.To motivate people to enhance their performance anddeal with depression is always a challenge for a leader. Ihave observed an analogy between a force fieldequilibrium and resistance to change in organizations. Letus imagine change to be a coiled spring in a field ofopposing forces, such that some forces support changeand others resist it. By increasing the supportive forcessuch as supervisory pressure, prospects of career growthand monetary benefits or decreasing the resisting forcessuch as group norms, social rewards, and work avoidance,the situation can be directed towards the desired result—but for a short time only, and that too only to a certainextent. After a while the resisting forces push back withgreater force as they are compressed even more tightly.Therefore, a better approach would be to decrease theresisting force in such a manner that there is noconcomittant increase in the supporting forces. In this way,less energy will be needed to bring about and maintainchange.The result of the forces I mentioned above, is motive. Itis a force which is internal to the individual and forms thebasis of his behaviour in the work environment. In myexperience, most people possess a strong inner drive forgrowth, competence, and self- actualization. The problem,however, has been the lack of a work environment thatstimulates and permits them to give full expression to thisdrive. Leaders can create a high productivity level byproviding the appropriate organizational structure and jobdesign, and by acknowledging and appreciating hard work.I first attempted to build up such a supportiveenvironment in 1983, while launching IGMDP. The projectswere in the design phase at that time. The re-organizationresulted in at least forty per cent to fifty per cent increase inthe level of activity. Now that the multiple projects wereentering into the development and flight-testing stage, themajor and minor milestones reached gave the programmevisibility and continuous commitment. With the absorptionof a young team of scientists, the average age had beenbrought down from 42 to 33 years. I felt it was time for asecond re-organization. But how should I go about it? I tookstock of the motivational inventory available at that time—let me explain to you what I mean by this term. The'),\n",

Wecreated a team of newly-joined young scientists with justone experienced person and gave them the challenge ofbuilding the strap-down inertial guidance system, an on-board computer and a ram rocket in propulsion system.These exercises were being attempted for the first time inthe country, and the technology involved was comparablewith world-class systems. The guidance technology iscentred around the gyro and accelerometer package, andelectronics, to process the sensor output. The on-boardcomputer carries the mission computations and flightsequencing. A ram rocket system breathes air to sustain itshigh velocity for long durations after it is put through abooster rocket. The young teams not only designed thesesystems but also developed them into operationalequipment. Later Prithvi and then Agni used similarguidance systems, with excellent results. The effort of theseyoung teams made the country self-reliant in the area ofprotected technologies. It was a good demonstration of the‘renewal factor’. Our intellectual capacity was renewedthrough contact with enthusiastic young minds and hadachieved these outstanding results.Now, besides the renewal of manpower, emphasis hadto be laid on augmenting the strength of project groups.Often people seek to satisfy their social, egoistic, and self-actualization needs at their workplaces. A good leadermust identify two different sets of environmental features.One, which satisfies a person’s needs and the other, whichcreates dissatisfaction with his work. We have alreadyobserved that people look for those characteristics in theirwork that relate to the values and goals which they considerimportant as giving meaning to their lives. If a job meets theemployees’need for achievement, recognition,responsibility, growth and advancement, they will work hardto achieve goals.Once the work is satisfying, a person then looks at theenvironment and circumstances in the workplace. Heobserves the policies of the administration, qualities of hisleader, security, status and working conditions. Then, hecorrelates these factors to the inter-personal relations hehas with his peers and examines his personal life in thelight of these factors. It is the agglomerate of all theseaspects that decides the degree and quality of a person’seffort and performance.The matrix organization evolved in 1983 provedexcellent in meeting all these requirements. So, whileretaining this structure of the laboratory, we undertook atask-design exercise. The scientists working in technologydirectorates were made system managers to interactexclusively with one project. An external fabrication wingwas formed under PK Biswas, a developmental fabricationtechnologist of long standing, to deal with the public sectorundertakings (PSUs) and private sector firms associatedwith the development of the missile hardware. This reducedpressure on the in-house fabrication facilities and enabledthem to concentrate on jobs which could not be undertakenoutside, which in fact occupied all the three shifts.'),\n",

Saraswatwith Y Gyaneshwar and P Venugopalan did acommendable job in this regard. They instilled in their teama sense of pride and achievement. The importance ofthese rocket engines was not restricted to the Prithviproject—it was a national achievement. Under theircollective leadership, a large number of engineers andtechnicians understood and committed themselves to theteam goals, as well as the specific goals which each one ofthem was committed to accomplish personally. Their entireteam worked under a self-evident sort of direction. Workingtogether with the Ordnance Factory, Kirkee, they alsocompletely eliminated the import content in the propellantfor these engines.Leaving the vehicle development in the safe andefficient hands of Sundaram and Saraswat, I startedlooking at the mission’s vulnerable areas. Meticulousplanning had gone into the development of the launchrelease mechanism (LRM) for the smooth lift-off of themissile. The joint development of explosive bolts to hold theLRM prior to the launch by DRDL and Explosive Researchand Development Laboratory (ERDL) was an excellentexample of multi- work centre coordination.While flying, drifting into spells of contemplation andlooking down at the landscape below has always been myfavourite preoccupation. It is so beautiful, so harmonious,so peaceful from a distance that I wonder where all thoseboundaries are which separate district from district, statefrom state, and country from country. Maybe such a senseof distance and detachment is required in dealing with allthe activities of our life.Since the Interim Test Range at Balasore was still atleast a year away from completion, we had set up specialfacilities at SHAR for the launch of Prithvi. These included alaunch pad, block house, control consoles and mobiletelemetry stations. I had a happy reunion with my old friendMR Kurup who was the Director, SHAR Centre by then.Working with Kurup on the Prithvi launch campaign gaveme great satisfaction. Kurup worked for Prithvi as a teammember, ignoring the boundary lines that divide DRDO andISRO, DRDL and SHAR. Kurup used to spend a lot of timewith us at the launch pad. He complemented us with hisexperience in range testing and range safety and workedwith great enthusiasm in propellant filling, making themaiden Prithvi launch campaign a memorable experience.Prithvi was launched at 11:23 hrs on 25 February 1988.It was an epoch-making event in the history of rocketry inthe country. Prithvi was not merely a surface-to-surfacemissile with a capability of delivering a 1000 kgconventional warhead to a distance of 150 km with anaccuracy of 50 meter CEP; it was in fact the basic modulefor all future guided missiles in the country. It already hadthe provision for modification from a long-range surface toan air missile system, and could also be deployed on aship.The accuracy of a missile is expressed in terms of itsCircular Error Probable (CEP).

A missile with a conventional high-explosivewarhead and a CEP of 1 km would not normally beexpected to destroy or disable fixed military targets such asa Command and Control Facility or an Air Base. It wouldhowever be effective against an undefined target such as acity.The German V-2 missiles fired at London betweenSeptember 1944 and March 1945 had a conventional high-explosive warhead and a very large CEP of some 17 km.Yet the 500 V-2s which hit London succeeded in causingmore than 21,000 casualties and destroying about 200,000homes.When the West were crying themselves hoarse over theNPT, we stressed upon building competence in coreguidance and control technologies to achieve a CEP asprecise as 50 m. With the success of the Prithvi trials, thecold reality of a possible strategic strike even without anuclear warhead had silenced the critics to whispers abouta possible technology-conspiracy theory.The launch of Prithvi sent shock waves across theunfriendly neighbouring countries. The response of theWestern bloc was initially one of shock and then of anger. Aseven-nation technology embargo was clamped, making itimpossible for India to buy anything even remotelyconnected with the development of guided missiles. Theemergence of India as a self-reliant country in the field ofguided missiles upset all the developed nations of theworld.* * *'),\n",

The robust civilianspace industry and viable missilebased defences hasbrought India into the select club of nations that callthemselves superpowers. Always encouraged to followBuddha’s or Gandhi’s teachings, how and why did Indiabecome a missile power is a question that needs to beanswered for future generations.Two centuries of subjugation, oppression and denialhave failed to kill the creativity and capability of the Indianpeople. Within just a decade of gaining independence andachieving sovereignty, Indian Space and Atomic EnergyProgrammes were launched with a perfect orientationtowards peaceful applications. There were neither funds forinvesting in missile development nor any establishedrequirement from the Armed Forces. The bitterexperiences of 1962 forced us to take the basic first stepstowards missile development.Would a Prithvi suffice? Would the indigenousdevelopment of four or five missile systems make ussufficiently strong? Or would having nuclear weapons makeus stronger? Missiles and atomic weapons are merelyparts of a greater whole. As I saw it, the development ofPrithvi represented the self-reliance of our country in thefield of advanced technology. High technology issynonymous with huge amounts of money and massiveinfrastructure. Neither of these was available, unfortunately,in adequate measure. So what could we do? Perhaps theAgni missile being developed as a technologydemonstrator project, pooling all the resources available inthe country, could provide an answer?I was very sure, even when we discussed REX in ISROabout a decade ago, that Indian scientists andtechnologists working together had the capability toachieve this technological breakthrough. India can mostcertainly achieve state-of-the-art technology through acombined effort of the scientific laboratories and theacademic institutions. If one can liberate Indian industryfrom the self-created image of being mere fabricatingfactories, they can implement indigenously developedtechnology and attain excellent results. To do this, weadopted a threefold strategy— multi-institutionalparticipation, the consortium approach, and theempowering technology. These were the stones rubbedtogether to create Agni.The Agni team was comprised of more than 500scientists. Many organizations were networked toundertake this huge effort of launching Agni. The Agnimission had two basic orientations— work and workers.Each member was dependent on the others in his team toaccomplish his target. Contradiction and confusion are thetwo things most likely to occur in such situations. Differentleaders accommodate concern for workers while gettingwork done, in their own personal ways. Some shed allconcern for workers in order to get results. They use peoplemerely as instruments to reach goals. Some give lessimportance to the work, and make an effort to gain thewarmth and approval of people working with them. But whatthis team achieved was the highest possible integration interms of both the quality of work and human relationships.Involvement, participation and commitment were the keywords to functioning.

VR Nagaraj was the leader of the electricalintegration team. Dedicated technologist that he is,Nagaraj would forget basic requirements like food andsleep while on the integration gig. His brother-in-lawpassed away while he was at ITR. His family kept thisinformation from Nagaraj so that there would be nointerruption in his work towards the launching of Agni.The Agni launch had been scheduled for 20 April 1989.This was going to be an unprecedented exercise. Unlikespace launch vehicles, a missile launch involves wide-ranging safety hazards. Two radars, three telemetrystations, one telecommand station and four electro-opticaltracking instruments to monitor the missile trajectory hadbeen deployed. In addition, the telemetry station at CarNicobar (ISTRAC) and the SHAR radars were alsocommissioned to track the vehicle. Dynamic surveillancewas employed to cover the electrical power that flows fromthe missile batteries within the vehicle and to controlsystem pressures. Should any deviation be noticed eitherin voltage or in pressure, the specially designed automaticcheckout system would signal “Hold”. The flight operationswould then be sequenced only if the defect was rectified.The countdown for the launch started at T-36 hours. Thecountdown from T-7.5 minutes was to be computercontrolled.All activities preparatory to the launch went according toschedule. We had decided to move the people living innearby villages to safety at the time of the launch. Thisattracted media attention, and led to much controversy. Bythe time 20 April 1989 arrived, the whole nation waswatching us. Foreign pressure was exerted throughdiplomatic channels to abort the flight trial, but the IndianGovernment stood behind us like a rock and staved off anydistraction to our work. We were at T-14 seconds when thecomputer signalled “Hold”, indicating that one of theinstruments was functioning erratically. This wasimmediately rectified. Meanwhile, the down-range stationasked for a “Hold”. In another few seconds, multiple Holdswere necessitated, resulting in irreversible internal powerconsumption. We had to abort the launch. The missile hadto be opened up to replace the on-board power supplies. Aweeping Nagaraj, by now informed about the tragedy in hisfamily, met me and promised that he would be back withinthree days. The profiles of these courageous people willnever be written about in any history book, but it is suchsilent people on whose hard work generations thrive andnations progress. Sending Nagaraj off, I met my teammembers who were in a state of shock and sorrow. Ishared my SLV-3 experience with them. “I lost my launchvehicle in the sea but recovered successfully. Your missileis in front of you. In fact you have lost nothing but a fewweeks of rework.” This shook them out of their immobilityand the entire team went back to retrieve the subsystemsand re-charge them.The press was up in arms, and fielded variousinterpretations of the postponement of the flight to suit thefancies of their readership.

But, again, during theautomatic computer checkout period at T10 seconds, aHold signal was indicated. A closer inspection showed thatone of the control components, S1-TVC was not workingaccording to the mission requirements. The launch had tobe postponed yet again. Now, such things are verycommon in rocketry and quite often happen in othercountries too. But the expectant nation was in no mood toappreciate our difficulties. The Hindu carried a cartoon byKeshav showing a villager counting some currency notesand commenting to another, “Yes, it’s the compensation formoving away from my hut near the test site—a few morepostponements and I can build a house of my own...”.Another cartoonist designated Agni as “ IDBM—Intermittently Delayed Ballistic Missile.” Amul’s cartoonsuggested that what Agni needed to do was use their butteras fuel!I took some time off, leaving my team at ITR to talk tothe DRDLRCI community. The entire DRDL-RCI communityassembled after working hours on 8 May 1989. Iaddressed the gathering of more than 2,000 persons, “Veryrarely is a laboratory or an R&D establishment given anopportunity to be the first in the country to develop a systemsuch as Agni. A great opportunity has been given to us.Naturally major opportunities are accompanied by equallymajor challenges. We should not give up and we should notallow the problem to defeat us. The country doesn’t deserveanything less than success from us. Let us aim forsuccess”. I had almost completed my address, when I foundmyself telling my people, “I promise you, we will be backafter successfully launching Agni before the end of thismonth.”Detailed analysis of the component failure during thesecond attempt led to the refurbishment of the controlsystem. This task was entrusted to a DRDO-ISRO team.The team carried out the rectification of the first stagecontrol system at the Liquid Propellant System Complex(LPSC) of ISRO and completed the task in record time withtremendous concentration and will-power. It was nothingshort of amazing how hundreds of scientists and staffworked continuously and completed the system readinesswith acceptance tests in just 10 days. The aircraft took offfrom Trivandrum with the rectified control systems andlanded close to ITR on the eleventh day. But now it was theturn of hostile weather conditions to impede us. A cyclonethreat was looming large. All the work centres wereconnected through satellite communication and HF links.Meteorological data started flowing in at ten-minuteintervals.Finally, the launch was scheduled for 22 May 1989. Theprevious night, Dr Arunachalam, Gen KN Singh and I werewalking together with the Defence Minister KC Pant, whohad come to ITR to witness the launch. It was a full-moonnight, it was high tide and the waves crashed and roared,as if singing of His glory and power. Would we succeedwith the Agni launch tomorrow? This question was foremostin all our minds, but none of us was willing to break the spellcast by the beautiful moonlit night. Breaking a long silence,the Defence Minister finally asked me, “Kalam! what wouldyou like me to do to celebrate the Agni success tomorrow?”It was a simple question, to which I could not think of ananswer immediately. What did I want? What was it that I didnot have? What could make me happier? And then I foundthe answer. “We need 100,000 saplings to plant at RCI,” I'),\n",

His face lit up with a friendly glow. “You are buying theblessings of Mother Earth for Agni,” Defence Minister KCPant quipped. “We will succeed tomorrow”, he predicted.The next day Agni took off at 0710 hrs. It was a perfectlaunch. The missile followed a textbook trajectory. All flightparameters were met. It was like waking up to a beautifulmorning from a nightmarish sleep. We had reached thelaunch pad after five years of continuous work at multiplework centres. We had lived through the ordeal of a series ofsnags in the last five weeks. We had survived pressurefrom everywhere to stop the whole thing. But we did it atlast! It was one of the greatest moments of my life. A mere600 seconds of elegant flight washed off our entire fatiguein an instant. What a wonderful culmination of our years oflabour. I wrote in my diary that night:Do not look at Agnias an entity directed upwardto deter the ominousor exhibit your might.It is firein the heart of an Indian.Do not even give itthe form of a missileas it clings to theburning pride of this nationand thus is bright.Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called the Agni launch “amajor achievement in our continuing efforts to safeguardour independence and security by self-reliant means. Thetechnology demonstration through Agni is a reflection of ourcommitment to the indigenous development of advancedtechnologies for the nation’s defence.” “The country isproud of your efforts,” he told me. President Venkataramansaw in the Agni success the fulfilment of his dream. Hecabled from Simla, “It is a tribute to your dedication, hardwork, and talent.”A great deal of misinformation and disinformation hadbeen spread by vested interests about this technologymission. Agni had never been intended only as a nuclearweapon system. What it did was to afford us the option ofdeveloping the ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons withhigh precision at long ranges. That it provided us with aviable nonnuclear option was of the greatest relevance tocontemporary strategic doctrines.Great ire was raised by the test firing of Agni, accordingto a wellknown American defence journal, especially in theUnited States where Congressmen threatened to put astop to all dual-use and missile-related technologies, alongwith all multinational aid.Gary Milhollin, a so-called specialist in missiles andwarhead technologies, had made a claim in The WallStreet Journal that India had made Agni with the help ofWest Germany. I had a hearty laugh reading that theGerman Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) haddeveloped Agni’s guidance system, the first-stage rocket,and a composite nose cone, and that the aerodynamicmodel of Agni was tested in the DLR wind tunnel. Animmediate denial came from the DLR, who in turnspeculated that France had supplied the Agni guidanceelectronics. American Senator Jeff Bingaman even went tothe extent of suggesting that I picked up everything neededfor Agni during my four-month stay at Wallop’s Island in1962. The fact that I was in Wallop’s Island more than 25years ago and at that time the technology used in Agni didnot exist even in the United States was not mentioned.'),\n",

Only when we are technologically self-reliantwill we able to fulfill their dream.Till the Agni launch, the Indian Armed Forces had beenstructured for a strictly defensive role to safeguard ournation, to shield our democratic processes from theturbulence in the countries around us and to raise the costof any external intervention to an unacceptable level forcountries which may entertain such notions. With Agni,India had reached the stage where she had the option ofpreventing wars involving her.Agni marked the completion of five years of IGMDP.Now that it had demonstrated our competence in the crucialarea of re-entry technology and with tactical missiles likePrithvi and Trishul already testfired, the launches of Nagand Akash would take us into areas of competence wherethere is little or no international competition. These twomissile systems contained within themselves the stuff ofmajor technological breakthroughs. There was a need tofocus our efforts more intensively on them.In September 1989, I was invited by the MaharashtraAcademy of Sciences in Bombay to deliver the JawaharlalNehru Memorial Lecture. I used this opportunity to sharewith the budding scientists my plans of making anindigenous Air-to-Air missile, Astra. It would dovetail withthe development of the Indian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).I told them that our work in Imaging Infra Red (IIR) andMillimetric Wave (MMW) radar technology for the Nagmissile system had placed us in the vanguard ofinternational R&D efforts in missile technology. I also drewtheir attention to the crucial role that carbon-carbon andother advanced composite materials play in mastering there-entry technology. Agni was the conclusion of atechnological effort that was given its start by PrimeMinister Indira Gandhi when the country decided to breakfree from the paralysing fetters of technologicalbackwardness and slough off the dead skin ofsubordination to industrialized nations.The second flight of Prithvi at the end of September1988 was again a great success. Prithvi has proved to bethe best surface-to-surface missile in the world today. It cancarry 1000 kg of warhead to a distance of 250 km anddeliver it within a radius of 50 metres. Through computercontrolled operations, numerous warhead weight anddelivery distance combinations can be achieved in a veryshort time and in battlefield conditions. It is a hundred percent indigenous in all respects—design, operations,deployment. It can be produced in large numbers as theproduction facilities at BDL were concurrently developedduring the development phase itself. The Army was quick torecognize the potential of this commendable effort andapproached the CCPA for placing orders for Prithvi andTrishul missile systems, something that had neverhappened before.* * * WINGS OF FIRE ORIENTATION - 1'),\n",

When I reachedMadurai, I asked after my high school teacher IyaduraiSolomon, who was by now a Reverend and eighty yearsold. I was told that he lived in a suburb of Madurai, so I tooka taxi and looked for his house. Rev. Solomon knew that Iwas going to give the convocation address that day.However, he had no way of getting there. There was atouching reunion between teacher and pupil. Dr PCAlexander, the Governor of Tamil Nadu, who was presidingover the function, was deeply moved on seeing the elderlyteacher who had not forgotten his pupil of long ago, andrequested him to share the dais.“Every convocation day of every University is likeopening the floodgates of energy which, once harnessed byinstitutions, organ-izations and industry, aids in nation-building,” I told the young graduates. Somehow I felt I wasechoing Rev. Solomon’s words, spoken about half acentury ago. After my lecture, I bowed down before myteacher. “Great dreams of great dreamers are alwaystranscended,” I told Rev. Solomon. “You have not onlyreached my goals, Kalam! You have eclipsed them,” he toldme in a voice choked with emotion.The next month, I happened to be in Trichi and used thatopportunity to visit St. Joseph’s College. I did not find Rev.Father Sequeira, Rev. Father Erhart, Prof. Subramanyam,Prof. Iyyamperumal Konar, or Prof. Thothathri Iyengar there,but it seemed to me that the stones of the St. Joseph’sbuilding still carried the imprint of the wisdom of those greatpeople. I shared with the young students my memories ofSt. Joseph’s and paid tribute to the teachers who hadmoulded me.We celebrated the nation’s forty-fourth IndependenceDay with the test firing of Akash.

I exhorted my colleagues tocommence user trials within the year. I knew that it wasgoing to be a tough task, but that was not going todiscourage us.Rear Admiral Mohan retired and his deputy, Kapoor,was to take over Trishul. I had always admired Mohan’sunderstanding of missile command guidance. This sailor-teacher-scientist could outwit any other expert in the countryin this field. I will always remember his candid exposition ofvarious aspects of the Command Line of Sight (CLOS)guidance system during the Trishul meetings. Once, heshowed me a verse that he had composed to highlight thewoes of an IGMDP Project Director. It was a good way ofletting off steam:I mpossible timeframes,PERT charts to bootAre driving me almost crazy as a coot;Presentations to MC add to one’s woes,If they solve anything, Heaven only knows.Meetings on holidays, even at night,The family is fed up,And all ready to fight.My hands are itchingto tear my hair —But alas!

On thenight of 15 January 1991, the Gulf War broke out betweenIraq and the Allied Forces led by the USA. In one stroke,thanks to satellite television invading Indian skies by thattime, rockets and missiles captured the imagination of theentire nation. People started discussing Scuds andPatriots in coffee houses and tea shops. Children beganflying paper kites shaped like missiles, and playing wargames along the lines of what they saw on Americantelevision networks. The successful test firing of Prithvi andTrishul during the course of the Gulf War was enough tomake an anxious nation relax. The newspaper reports ofthe programmable trajectory capability of the Prithvi andTrishul guidance system, using microwave frequencies invirtually unjammable bands, created widespreadawareness. The nation was quick to draw parallelsbetween the missiles operational in the Gulf War and ourown warhead carriers. A common query I encountered waswhether Prithvi was superior to a Scud, whether Akashcould perform like a Patriot, and so on. Hearing a “Yes” ora “Why not?” from me, people’s faces would light up withpride and satisfaction.The Allied Forces had a marked technological edge, asthey were fielding systems built using the technologies ofthe eighties and nineties.

Themissile force coupled with the electronic warfare used inthe Gulf War was a feast for military strategic experts. Itacted as a curtainraiser for the twenty-first century warscenario with missiles and electronic and informationwarfare playing the lead roles.In India, even today, the term technology, for mostpeople, conjures up images of smoky steel mills or clankingmachines. This is a rather inadequate conception of whattechnology denotes. The invention of the horse collar in theMiddle Ages led to major changes in agricultural methods,and was as much a technological advance as the inventionof the Bessemer furnace centuries later. Moreover,technology includes techniques as well as the machinesthat may or may not be necessary to apply them. It includesways to make chemical reactions occur, ways to breed fish,eradicate weeds, light theatres, treat patients, teachhistory, fight wars, or even prevent them.Today, most advanced technological processes arecarried out far from assembly lines or open hearths. Indeed,in electronics, in space technology, in most of the newindustries, relative silence and clean surroundings arecharacteristic, even essential. The assembly line, with theorganization of armies of men, to carry out simple, routinefunctions is an anachronism. Our symbols of technologymust change before we can keep pace with changes intechnology itself. We should never forget that technologyfeeds on itself. Technology makes more technologypossible. In fact, technological innovation consists of threestages linked together in a self-reinforcing cycle. First,there is the creative stage, with the blueprint of a feasibleidea. This is made real by its practical application, and thisfinally ends in its diffusion through society. The process isthen complete; the loop is closed when the diffusion oftechnology embodying the new idea in its turn helpsgenerate new creative ideas. Today, all over the developedworld, the time gap between each of the steps in this cyclehas been shortened. In India, we are just progressingtowards that stage—closing the loop.After the Gulf War concluded with the victory of thetechnologically superior Allied Forces, over 500 scientistsof DRDL and RCI gathered to discuss issues that hademerged. I posed a question before the assembly: wastechnology or weapon symmetry with other nations feasible,and if so, should it be attempted? The discussion led tomany more serious questions, such as, how to establisheffective electronic warfare support? How to make missiledevelopment proceed apace with the development ofequally necessary systems like the LCA; and what were thekey areas where a push would bring progress?At the end of a lively discussion spread over threehours, the consensus emerged that there was no way toredress asymmetry in military capability except to have thesame capability in specific areas as your potentialopponent. The scientists vowed to achieve a reduced CEPin the accuracy of Prithvi’s delivery, perfecting the Ka bandguidance system for Trishul and realising all carbon-carbonre-entry control surfaces for Agni by the end of the year. Thevow was later fulfilled. The year also saw tubelaunched Nagflights, and the manoeuvre of Trishul at seven metres abovesea level, at speeds which exceeded three times the speedof sound. The latter was a breakthrough in the development'),\n",

In the citation readby Prof. B Nag on the occasion, I was described as “aninspiration behind the creation of a solid technologicalbase from which India’s future aerospace programmes canbe launched to meet the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury”. Well, perhaps Prof. Nag was only being polite, butI do believe that India will enter the next century with its ownsatellite in geo-stationary orbit 36,000 km away in space,positioned by its own launch vehicle. India will also becomea missile power. Ours is a country with tremendous vitality.Even though the world may not see its full potential or feelits full power, no one dare ignore it any more.On 15 October, I turned sixty. I looked forward toretirement and planned to open a school for the lessprivileged children. My friend, Prof. P Rama Rao, who washeading the Department of Science and Technology in theGovernment of India, even struck up a partnership with meto establish what he called the Rao-Kalam school. We wereunanimous in our opinion that carrying out certain missionsand reaching certain milestones, however important theymay be or however impressive they might appear to be, isnot all there is to life. But we had to postpone our plan asneither of us was relieved from our post by the Governmentof India.It was during this period that I decided to put down mymemoirs and express my observations and opinions oncertain issues.The biggest problem Indian youth faced, I felt, was alack of clarity of vision, a lack of direction. It was then that Idecided to write about the circumstances and people whomade me what I am today; the idea was not merely to paytribute to some individuals or highlight certain aspects ofmy life. What I wanted to say was that no one, howeverpoor, underprivileged or small, need feel disheartenedabout life. Problems are a part of life. Suffering is theessence of success. As someone said:God has not promisedSkies always blue,Flower-strewn pathwaysAll our life through;God has not promisedSun without rain,Joy without sorrow,Peace without pain.I will not be presumptuous enough to say that my life canbe a role model for anybody; but some poor child living inan obscure place, in an underprivileged social setting mayfind a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped. Itcould perhaps help such children liberate themselves fromthe bondage of their illusory backwardness andhopelessness. Irrespective of where they are right now, theyshould be aware that God is with them and when He is withthem, who can be against them?But God has promisedStrength for the day,Rest for the labourLight for the way.It has been my observation that most Indians sufferunnecessary misery all their lives because they do not knowhow to manage their emotions. They are paralysed bysome sort of a psychological inertia.

It is notbased on individual intelligence, but on the interaction ofmany people. I think the biggest success of IGMDP is notthe fact that inrecord time the country acquired the capability ofmaking five state-ofthe-art missile systems but that throughit, some superb teams of scientists and engineers havebeen created. If someone asks me about my personalachievements in Indian rocketry, I would put it down tohaving created a challenging environment for teams ofyoung people to work in.In their formative stages, teams are much like childrenin spirit. They are as excitable, as full of vitality, enthusiasm,curiosity and the desire to please and excel. As withchildren, however, these positive attributes can bedestroyed by the behaviour of misguided parents. Forteams to be successful, the environment must offer scopefor innovation. I confronted many such challenges during thecourse of my work at DTD&P (Air), ISRO, DRDO andelsewhere, but always ensured for my teams anenvironment which allowed innovation and risk-taking.When we first began creating project teams during theSLV-3 project and later in IGMDP, people working in theseteams found themselves in the frontline of theirorganizations’ ambitions. Since a great deal ofpsychological investment had been made in these teams,they became both highly visible and highly vulnerable. Theywere personally expected to make a disproportionatecontribution to win collective glory.I was aware that any failure in the organizational supportsystem would negate the investment in team strategies.The teams would be relegated to the league of averageworking groups and might fail even there, unable to meetthe high expectations set for them. On several occasions,the organization was on the verge of losing its nerve andimposing restraints. The high level of uncertainty andcomplexity associated with team activity very often provesto be a trap for the unwary.In the early years of the SLV-3 project, I often had tocounter nervousness of the top people because progresswas not tangibly or immediately visible. Many felt that theorganization had lost control over SLV-3, that the teamwould run on unchecked, and cause chaos and confusion.But on all occasions, these fears were proved imaginary.There were many people in powerful positions inorganizations, for example at VSSC, who underestimatedour responsibility and commitment to organizationalobjectives. Dealing with such people was a crucial part ofthe whole operation, and this was performed dexterously byDr Brahm Prakash.When you work as a project team, you need to developa complex view of the success criteria. There are alwaysmultiple and often conflicting sets of expectations that existabout a team’s performance. Then, quite often, the projectteams are virtually torn apart in their attempt toaccommodate the needs and constraints of sub-contractors outside the organization and specialistdepartments within the organization. Good project teamsare able to quickly identify the key person or people withwhom negotiations must take place. A crucial aspect of theteam leader’s role is to negotiate with these key people fortheir requirements, and to ensure that the dialogue'),\n",

If there is one thing outsiders dislike, it isunpleasant surprises. Good teams ensure that there arenone.The SLV-3 team developed their own internal successcriteria. We articulated our standards, expectations andobjectives. We summarised what was needed to happenfor us to be successful and how we would measuresuccess. For instance, how we were going to accomplishour tasks, who would do what and according to whatstandards, what were the time limits and how would theteam conduct itself with reference to others in theorganization.The process of arriving at the success criteria within ateam is an intricate and skilled one because there are a lotof things going on below the surface. On the surface, theteam is simply working to achieve the project’s goals. But Ihave repeatedly seen how people are poor at articulatingwhat they want—until they see a work centre doingsomething they don’t want them to do. A project teammember must in fact act like a detective. He should probefor clues as to how the project is proceeding, and thenpiece together different bits of evidence to build up a clear,comprehensive and deep understanding of the project’srequirements.At another level, the relationship between the projectteams and the work centres should be encouraged anddeveloped by the project leader. Both parties must be veryclear in their minds about their mutual interdependence andthe fact that both of them have a stake in the project. At yetanother level, each side should assess the other’scapabilities and identify areas of strength and weakness inorder to plan what needs doing and how it should be done.In fact, the whole game can be seen as a process ofcontracting. It is about exploring and arriving at anagreement on what each party expects of the other; aboutrealistically understanding the constraints of the other party;and about communicating the success criteria whiledefining some simple rules about how the relationship is towork; but above all, it’s the best means of developing clarityin the relationship, both at the technical and personal levels,in order to avoid any nasty surprises in the future. InIGMDP, Sivathanu Pillai and his team did someremarkable work in this area through their home-growntechnique, PACE, which stands for Programme Analysis,Control and Evaluation. Each day between 12 noon and 1p.m., they would sit with a project team and a particularwork centre that was on the critical path and assess thelevel of success among themselves. The excitement ofplanning ways to succeed and the vision of future successprovide an irresistible form of motivation which, I havefound, always makes things happen.The concept of Technology Management has its roots inthe Developmental Management models which originatedin the early Sixties out of a conflict between harmony-seeking and output-oriented management structures. Thereare basically two types of management orientations: primal,which values an economic employee, and rational, whichvalues an organizational employee. My concept ofmanagement is woven around an employee who is atechnology person. While the primal management schoolrecognizes people for their independence, and rationalmanagement acknowledges them for their dependability, Ivalue them for their interdependence. Whereas the primalmanager champions independent enterprise and therational manager serves cooperation, I moot'),\n",

InEurope, Rudolf Steiner and Reg Revans developed thisconcept into the system of individual learning andorganizational renewal. The Anglo-German managementphilosopher, Fritz Schumacher introduced Buddhisteconomics and authored the concept of “Small isBeautiful”. In the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhiemphasized grass root level technology and put thecustomer at the centre of the entire business activity. JRDTata brought in progressdriven infrastructure. Dr HomiJehangir Bhabha and Prof. Vikram Sarabhai launched thehigh, technology-based atomic energy and spaceprogrammes with a clear-cut emphasis on the natural lawsof totality and flow. Advancing the developmentalphilosophy of Dr Bhabha and Prof. Sarabhai, Dr MSSwaminathan ushered the Green Revolution into Indiaworking on another natural principle of integrity. DrVerghese Kurien brought in a powerful cooperativemovement through a revolution in the dairy industry. Prof.Satish Dhawan developed mission management conceptsin space research. These are but a few examples ofindividuals who have not only articulated but alsoimplemented their ideas, thus changing forever the face ofresearch and business organizations all over the world.In the IGMDP, I attempted to integrate the vision of Prof.Sarabhai and the mission of Prof. Dhawan by adapting thehigh technology setting of Dr Brahm Prakash’s spaceresearch. I attempted to add the natural law of Latency infounding the Indian Guided Missile Programme in order tocreate a completely indigenous variety of technologymanagement. Let me use a metaphor to illuminate this.The tree of technology management takes root only ifthere is the self-actualization of needs, renewal,interdependence, and natural flow. The growth patterns arecharacteristic of the evolution process, which means thatthings move in a combination of slow change and suddentransformation; each transformation causes either a leapinto a new, more complex level or a devastating crash tosome earlier level; dominant models reach a certain peakof success when they turn troublesome; and the rate ofchange always accelerates.The stem of the tree is the molecular structure in whichall actions are formative, all policies are normative, and alldecisions are integrative. The branches of this tree areresources, assets, operations, and products which arenourished by the stem through a continuous performanceevaluation and corrective update.This tree of technology management, if carefully tended,bears the fruits of an adaptive infrastructure: technologicalempowerment of the institutions, the generation of technicalskills among people, and finally self-reliance of the nationand improvement in the quality of life of its citizenry.When IGMDP was sanctioned in 1983, we did not havean adequate technology base. A few pockets of expertisewere available, but we lacked the authority to utilize thatexpert technology. The multi-project environment of theprogramme provided a challenge, for five advanced missilesystems had to be simultaneously developed. Thisdemanded judicious sharing of resources, establishingpriorities, and ongoing induction of manpower. Eventually,the IGMDP had 78 partners, including 36 technology'),\n",

In themanagement of the Programme, as much as in thetechnological inputs, we attempted to develop a model thatwas appropriate, even tailor-made, for our very specificneeds and capabilities. We borrowed ideas that had beendeveloped elsewhere, but adapted them in the light of whatwe knew were our strengths and what we recognized as theconstraints we would be compelled to work under. All in all,the combination of appropriate management and ourcooperative endeavours helped to unearth the talent andpotential that lay unused in our research laboratories,government institutions and private industries.The Technology Management philosophy of IGMDP isnot exclusive to missile development. It represents thenational urge to succeed and an awareness that the worldwill never again be directed by muscle or money power. Infact, both these powers will depend on technologicalexcellence. Technology respects only technology. And, as Isaid in the beginning, technology, unlike science, is a groupactivity. It does not grow only through individual intelligence,but by intelligences interacting and ceaselessly individualintelligence, but by intelligences interacting and ceaselesslystrong Indian family which also makes missile systems.There has been much speculation and philosophizingabout the life and times of our scientists, but not enoughexploration in determining where they wanted to go andhow they reached there. In sharing with you the story of mystruggle to become a person, I have perhaps given yousome insight into this journey. I hope it will help at least afew young people to stand up to the authoritarianism in oursociety. A characteristic feature of this socialauthoritarianism is its insidious ability to addict people tothe endless pursuit of external rewards, wealth, prestige,position, promotion, approval of one’s lifestyle by others,ceremonial honours, and status symbols of all kinds.To successfully pursue these goals, they have to learnelaborate rules of etiquette and familiarize themselves withcustoms, traditions, protocols and so on. The youth of todaymust unlearn this self-defeating way of life. The culture ofworking only for material possessions and rewards must bediscarded.

At times, I oftenlaughed at his impatience, and read for him these linesfrom T.S. Eliot’s Hollow Men:Between the conceptionAnd the creationBetween the emotionAnd the responseFalls the Shadow.Defence R&D at that time was heavily dependent onimported equipment. Virtually nothing indigenous wasavailable. Together, we made a long shopping list anddrew up an import plan. But this made me unhappy—wasthere no remedy or alternative? Was this nation doomed tolive with screwdriver technology? Could a poor country likeIndia afford this kind of development?One day, while working late in the office, which wasquite routine after I took up the RATO projects, I saw ayoung colleague, Jaya Chandra Babu going home. Babuhad joined us a few months ago and the only thing I knewabout him was that he had a very positive attitude and wasarticulate. I called him into my office and did a bit of loudthinking. “Do you have any suggestions?” I then asked him.Babu remained silent for a while, and then asked for timeuntil the next evening to do some homework beforeanswering my question.The next evening, Babu came to me before theappointed time. His face was beaming with promise. “Wecan do it, sir! The RATO system can be made withoutimports. The only hurdle is the inherent inelasticity in theapproach of the organization towards procurement andsubcontracting, which would be the two major thrust areasto avoid imports.” He gave me seven points, or, rather,asked for seven liberties—financial approval by a singleperson instead of an entire hierarchy, air travel for allpeople on work irrespective of their entitlement,accountability to only one person, lifting of goods by air-cargo, sub-contracting to the private sector, placement oforders on the basis of technical competence, andexpeditious accounting procedures.These demands were unheard of in governmentestablishments, which tend to be conservative, yet I couldsee the soundness of his proposition. The RATO projectwas a new game and there was nothing wrong if it was tobe played with a new set of rules. I weighed all the pros andcons of Babu’s suggestions for a whole night and finallydecided to present them to Prof. Sarabhai. Hearing myplea for administrative liberalization and seeing the meritsbehind it, Prof. Sarabhai approved the proposals without asecond thought.Through his suggestions, Babu had highlighted theimportance of business acumen in developmental workwith high stakes. To make things move faster withinexisting work parameters, you have to pump in morepeople, more material and more money. If you can’t do that,change your parameters! Instinctive businessman that hewas, Babu did not remain long with us and left ISRO forgreener pastures in Nigeria. I could never forget Babu’scommon sense in financial matters.We had opted for a composite structure for the RATOmotor casing using filament fibre glass/epoxy. We had alsogone in for a high energy composite propellant and anevent-based ignition and jettisoning system in real-time. Acanted nozzle was designed to deflect the jet away from theaircraft. We conducted the first static test of RATO in the'),\n",

He offered no explanation of how he knew that Iwas sad and I did not ask.I told him about my unsuccessful attempt to join theIndian Air Force and my long-cherished desire to fly. Hesmiled, washing away all my anxiety almost instantly. Thenhe said in a feeble, but very deep voice,Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when itis pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagneticenergy. This energy is released into the ether each night,as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning itreturns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmiccurrents. That which has been imaged will surely andcertainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon thisageless promise as surely as you can rely upon theeternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.When the student is ready, the teacher will appear—How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to astudent who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destinyand go ahead with your life. You are not destined tobecome an Air Force pilot. What you are destined tobecome is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forgetthis failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destinedpath. Search, instead, for the true purpose of yourexistence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrenderyourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.I returned to Delhi and enquired at the DTD&P(Air)about the outcome of my interview. In response, I washanded my appointment letter. I joined the next day asSenior Scientific Assistant on a basic salary of Rs 250/-per month. If this was to be my destiny, I thought, let it be so.Finally, I was filled with mental peace. No more did I feelany bitterness or resentment at my failure to enter the AirForce. All this was in 1958.At the Directorate, I was posted at the Technical Centre(Civil Aviation). If I was not flying aeroplanes, I was at leasthelping to make them airworthy. During my first year in theDirectorate, I carried out a design assignment onsupersonic target aircraft with the help of the officer-in-charge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from theDirector, Dr Neelakantan. To gain shop-floor exposure toaircraft maintenance, I was sent to the Aircraft andArmament Testing Unit (A&ATU) at Kanpur. At that time,they were involved in a tropical evaluation of Gnat Mk Iaircraft. I participated in the performance assessment of itsoperation systems.Even in those days, Kanpur was a very populous city. Itwas my first experience of living in an industrial town. Thecold weather, crowds, noise and smoke were in totalcontrast to what I was used to in Rameswaram. I wasparticularly troubled by the ubiquitous presence of potatoeson the dining table, right from breakfast to dinner. To me, itseemed that a feeling of loneliness pervaded the city. Thepeople on the streets had all come from their villages insearch of jobs in factories, leaving behind the smell of theirsoil and the protection of their families.On my return to Delhi, I was informed that the design ofa DART target had been taken up at the DTD&P (Air) andthat I had been included in the design team. I completedthis task with the other team members. Then, I undertook apreliminary design study on a Human Centrifuge. I latercarried out the design and development of a VerticalTakeoff and Landing Platform. I was also associated withthe development and construction of the Hot Cockpit. Threeyears passed. Then the Aeronautical DevelopmentEstablishment (ADE) was born in Bangalore and I wasposted to the new establishment.'),\n",

They are the best examples ofsmall-town Indian teachers committed to nurturingtalent.“He who knows others is learned, but the wise one is theone who knows himself. Learning without wisdom is of nouse.”In the course of my education at MIT, three teachersshaped my thinking. Their combined contributions formedthe foundation on which I later built my professional career.These three teachers were Prof. Sponder, Prof. KAVPandalai and Prof. Narasingha Rao. Each one of them hadvery distinct personalities, but they shared a commonimpulse— the capacity to feed their students’ intellectualhunger by sheer brilliance and untiring zeal.Prof. Sponder taught me technical aerodynamics. Hewas an Austrian with rich practical experience inaeronautical engineering. During the Second World War,he had been captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in aconcentration camp. Understandably, he had developed avery strong dislike for Germans. Inciden- tally, theaeronautical department was headed by a German, Prof.Walter Repenthin. Another well-known professor, Dr KurtTank, was a distinguished aeronautical engineer who haddesigned the German Focke–Wulf FW 190 single-seaterfighter plane, an outstanding combat aircraft of the SecondWorld War. Dr Tank later joined the Hindustan AeronauticsLimited (HAL) in Bangalore and was responsible for thedesign of India’s first jet fighter, the HF-24 Marut.Notwithstanding these irritants, Prof. Sponderpreserved his individuality and maintained highprofessional standards. He was always calm, energeticand in total control of himself. He kept abreast of the latest')]"
